\begin{document}
The easiest way to make sure that the paper conformed with the requirement is to use this document as a template and copy and paste your content into this document. The main part of the paper is formatted into two equal-width columns with 0.75 cm spacing. Section headings should be concise and numbered sequentially, using a decimal system for subsections. Emphasized words should be italicized, but such emphasis should be sparingly used.
