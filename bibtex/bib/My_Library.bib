We begin by discussing the limitations of reductive conceptions of disability. In so doing, we consider how far Bourdieu’s (1990) concept of habitus offers a way of bringing an analysis of the body to bear upon an understanding of the social inequalities which are core to the lives of disabled people. Through focus groups with disabled people, the article explores aspects of disabled people’s corporeal identities, feelings and (embodied) encounters in a range of social settings. The research shows that disabled people’s lives are connected to different ‘valuations’ attributed to corporeal forms, and to systems of signiﬁcation and representation, which underpin them. We conclude by reafﬁrming the need to consider Bourdieu’s ideas in helping in the development of disability theory.},

This poset {NPol}(d) is a natural discrete counterpart of the continuum of convex compact sets in Rd , ordered by inclusion, and exhibits a remarkably rich combinatorial structure. We derive various arithmetic bounds on elementary relations in {NPol}(d), called quantum jumps. The existence of extremal objects in {NPol}(d) is a challenge of number theoretical ﬂavor, leading to interesting classes of normal polytopes: minimal, maximal, spherical. Minimal elements in {NPol}(5) have played a critical role in disproving various covering conjectures for normal polytopes in the 1990s. Here we report on the ﬁrst examples of maximal elements in {NPol}(4) and {NPol}(5), found by a combination of the developed theory, random generation, and extensive computer search.},

It analyses the theoretical underpinnings, research methods and definitions of identity, providing a critique rather than a summary of the literature. A total of 188 articles from 85 different journals are reviewed in the sample. This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.},

	abstract = {Background As the maker movement is increasingly adopted into K-12 schools, students are developing new competences in exploration and fabrication technologies. This study assesses learning with these technologies in K-12 makerspaces and {FabLabs}.
Purpose Our study describes the iterative process of developing an assessment instrument for this new technological literacy, the Exploration and Fabrication Technologies Instrument, and presents ﬁndings from implementations at ﬁve schools in three countries. Our index is generalizable and psychometrically sound, and permits comparison between student conﬁdence and performance. Design/Method Our evaluation of distinct technology skills separates general computing, information and communication technology ({ICT}), and exploration and fabrication technologies ({EFTs}) into nonoverlapping areas of technological expertise required to perform their respective sets of tasks. The instrument also tracks student conﬁdence in {EFT} skills and assesses how that conﬁdence relates to actual task performance.
Results Exploration and fabrication technologies constitute a new and distinct set of technology literacies arising from fabrication settings. The {EFT} instrument compares students’ selfreported conﬁdence with their performance on complex design tasks and demonstrates that, for students, exposure to general computing and {ICT} tools differs from exposure to {EFT} tools.
Conclusion The {EFT} instrument captures a new and distinct set of technology literacies that arise within fabrication settings and are independent of both general computing and digital content production skills.},

	abstract = {When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do--with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?
This book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to these and other questions. New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.
How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.
If education is to help students make sense of their surroundings and ready them for the challenges of the technology-driven, internationally competitive world, then it must be based on what we know about learning from science. In that light, this book will be of significant professional interest to teachers, education policymakers and administrators, and curriculum developers.},

Both the medical and economic definitions have relied primarily on clinical methods. Whereas the medical approach has been operationally measured by limits on major life activities, the economic orientation has been measured by restrictions on the amount or kind of work that can be performed. By contrast, the sociopolitical definition, which focuses on the interaction between the individual and the environment, can be empirically assessed by measures of visibility and labeling. Self-identification is also an important index of the relative size and political strength of disabled persons. Because of the significance of new antidiscrimination laws, which appear to be based on the minority-group model, there is a pressing need to grant operational measures of the sociopolitical definition a position of parity in relation to the vast amount of data that have already been accumulated through the use of medical and economic concepts in government and other surveys.},

	shorttitle = {Women 1.5 Times More Likely to Leave {STEM} Pipeline after Calculus Compared to Men},
	abstract = {The substantial gender gap in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) workforce can be traced back to the underrepresentation of women at various milestones in the career pathway. Calculus is a necessary step in this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing {STEM} fields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested in {STEM} and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking Calculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a {STEM} major or are dissuaded from {STEM} disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on mainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for academic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman being dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for a man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material well enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women and men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find women start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence than men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack of mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of women. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women in {STEM} at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that if women persisted in {STEM} at the same rate as men starting in Calculus I, the number of women entering the {STEM} workforce would increase by 75\%.},

Drawing on personal experience in the ﬁeld, the author responds to several important considerations that need to be addressed before considering adopting this controversial perspective. The paper is divided into two main sections. The ﬁrst part provides a concise introduction to the thinking that underpins the concept of emancipatory disability research. The second section discusses key elements of this approach including the problem of accountability, the social model of disability, choice of methods and, empowerment, dissemination and outcomes. The paper concludes by suggesting that whilst there has been considerable progress over the last decade the future of emancipatory disability research remains precarious.},

The framework for cultural learning pathways is an application and elaboration of Ole Dreier’s theory of persons in diversities of structures of social practice with a focus on the learning of disciplinary practices and the development of discipline-related identities. We summarize relevant learning phenomena along extended cultural pathways from three team ethnographies of science learning. We outline how power-related issues associated with privilege and marginalization are attended to in relation to the social, cultural, and material circumstances of learning within and across environments and discuss future research opportunities.},

The informing of research influences how it is carried out ; the research questions themselves, the choice of design and methods, the form of analysis, and the pattern of dissemination. The seminar series has helped {SPRU} reappraise its disability-related research . Disabled people must be able to influence the framing and elaboration of research questions more directly; there must be an increased commitment to employing and to training disabled researchers ; dissemination must be wider; `crucial gateways' to policy makers and practitioners have to be identified ; and the debate on informal care must be moved further on .},

	abstract = {When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do--with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?
This book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to these and other questions. New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.
How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.
If education is to help students make sense of their surroundings and ready them for the challenges of the technology-driven, internationally competitive world, then it must be based on what we know about learning from science. In that light, this book will be of significant professional interest to teachers, education policymakers and administrators, and curriculum developers.},

	abstract = {With the current trend away from affirmative action programs, it is increasingly important that universities retain the African American and Latino students that they admit. In 1988 the University of Texas at Austin ({UT}) established the Emerging Scholars Program ({ESP}) to challenge high-achieving students to excel in calculus and pursue mathematics, science, or engineering ({MSE}) majors. The university makes a special effort to recruit African Americans, Latinos, and women, but the {ESP} is open to any student, regardless of race or ethnicity, who is committed to excel in calculus. We analyze the influence of calculus performance on choosing a mathematics, science, or engineering major by focusing on variations by race, ethnicity, and gender and on the role of students' participation in the {ESP}. Findings suggest that {ESP} students earn higher calculus grades than non-{ESP} students and are more likely to enroll in the second semester of calculus. Also, earning higher calculus grades increases the likelihood that students will choose a major in mathematics, science, or engineering. These findings suggest that to increase the number of students choosing one of these majors, administrators must seek ways to increase students' participation in calculus each semester. In addition, African Americans, Latinos, and women excel in calculus if they receive appropriate academic challenges and support.},

	abstract = {In this important theoretical treatist, Jean Lave, anthropologist, and Etienne Wenger, computer scientist, push forward the notion of situated learning - that learning is fundamentally a social process. The authors maintain that learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral participation ({LPP}). Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. {LPP} provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and old-timers and about their activities, identities, artefacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalised to other social groups.},

	title = {Critical Theory},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/critical-theory/},
	abstract = {Critical Theory has a narrow and a broad meaning in philosophy and inthe history of the social sciences. “Critical Theory” inthe narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophersand social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition knownas the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a“critical” theory may be distinguished from a“traditional” theory according to a specific practicalpurpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human“emancipation from slavery”, acts as a “liberating… influence”, and works “to create a world whichsatisfies the needs and powers” of human beings (Horkheimer1972, 246).  Because such theories aim to explain andtransform all the circumstances that enslave human beings,many “critical theories” in the broader sense have beendeveloped. They have emerged in connection with the many socialmovements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of humanbeings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses,however, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normativebases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasingfreedom in all their forms., Critical Theory in the narrow sense has had many different aspects andquite distinct historical phases that cross several generations, fromthe effective start of the Institute for Social Research in the years1929–1930, which saw the arrival of the Frankfurt Schoolphilosophers and an inaugural lecture by Horkheimer, to thepresent. Its distinctiveness as a philosophical approach that extendsto ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history is mostapparent when considered in light of the history of the philosophy ofthe social sciences. Critical Theorists have long sought todistinguish their aims, methods, theories, and forms of explanationfrom standard understandings in both the natural and the socialsciences. Instead, they have claimed that social inquiry ought tocombine rather than separate the poles of philosophy and the socialsciences: explanation and understanding, structure and agency,regularity and normativity.  Such an approach, Critical Theoristsargue, permits their enterprise to be practical in adistinctively moral (rather than instrumental) sense. They do notmerely seek to provide the means to achieve some independent goal, butrather (as in Horkheimer's famous definition mentioned above) seek“human emancipation” in circumstances of domination andoppression. This normative task cannot be accomplished apart from theinterplay between philosophy and social science throughinterdisciplinary empirical social research (Horkheimer 1993). {WhileCritical} Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to {theFrankfurt} School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretchesto Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similarpractical aims could be called a “critical theory,”including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms ofpost-colonial criticism. In the following, Critical Theory whencapitalized refers only to the Frankfurt School. All other uses of theterm are meant in the broader sense and thus not capitalized. Whenused in the singular, “a critical theory” is notcapitalized, even when the theory is developed by members of {theFrankfurt} School in the context of their overall project of {CriticalTheory}., It follows from Horkheimer's definition that a critical theory isadequate only if it meets three criteria: it must be explanatory,practical, and normative, all at the same time. That is, it mustexplain what is wrong with current social reality, identify the actorsto change it, and provide both clear norms for criticism andachievable practical goals for social transformation. Any trulycritical theory of society, as Horkheimer further defined it in hiswritings as Director of the Frankfurt School's Institute for {SocialResearch}, “has as its object human beings as producers of theirown historical form of life” (Horkeimer 1993, 21). In light ofthe practical goal of identifying and overcoming all the circumstancesthat limit human freedom, the explanatory goal could be furthered onlythrough interdisciplinary research that includes psychological,cultural, and social dimensions, as well as institutional forms ofdomination. Given the emphasis among the first generation of {CriticalTheory} on human beings as the self-creating producers of their ownhistory, a unique practical aim of social inquiry suggests itself: totransform contemporary capitalism into a consensual form of sociallife. For Horkheimer a capitalist society could be transformed only bybecoming more democratic, to make it such that “all conditionsof social life that are controllable by human beings depend on realconsensus” in a rational society (Horkheimer 1972, 249–250). Thenormative orientation of Critical Theory, at least in its form ofcritical social inquiry, is therefore towards the transformation ofcapitalism into a “real democracy” in which such controlcould be exercised (Horkheimer 1972, 250). In such formulations, thereare striking similarities between Critical Theory and Americanpragmatism., The focus on democracy as the location for cooperative, practical andtransformative activity continues today in the work of {JürgenHabermas}, as does the attempt to determine the nature and limits of“real democracy” in complex, pluralistic, and globalizingsocieties., As might be expected from such an ambitious philosophical project andform of inquiry, Critical Theory is rife with tensions. In whatfollows I will develop the arguments within Critical Theory thatsurround its overall philosophical project. First, I explore its basicphilosophical orientation or metaphilosophy. In its efforts to combineempirical social inquiry and normative philosophical argumentation,Critical Theory presents a viable alternative for social and politicalphilosophy today. Second, I will consider its core normativetheory—its relation to its transformation of a Kantian ethics ofautonomy into a conception of freedom and justice in which democracyand democratic ideals play a central role (Horkheimer 1993, 22;Horkheimer 1972, 203). As a member of the second generation {ofCritical} Theory, Habermas in particular has developed this dimensionof normative political theory into a competitor to Rawlsianconstructivism, which attempts to bring our pretheoretical intuitionsinto reflective equilibrium. In the third section, I will consider itsempirical orientation in practical social theory and practical socialinquiry that aims at promoting democratic norms. A fundamental tensionemerges between a comprehensive social theory that provides atheoretical basis for social criticism and a more pluralist andpractical orientation that does not see any particular theory ormethodology as distinctive of Critical Theory as such. In this way,the unresolved tension between the empirical and normative aspects ofthe project of a critical theory oriented to the realization of humanfreedom is manifest in each of its main contributions to philosophyinformed by social science. Finally, I examine the contribution {ofCritical} Theory to debates about globalization, in which the potentialtransformation of both democratic ideals and institutions is atstake.},

	title = {Pragmatism},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/pragmatism/},
	abstract = {Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that – very broadly– understands knowing the world as inseparable from agencywithin it. This general idea has attracted a remarkably richand at times contrary range of interpretations, including: that allphilosophical concepts should be tested via scientificexperimentation, that a claim is true if and only if it is useful(relatedly: if a philosophical theory does not contribute directly tosocial progress then it is not worth much), that experience consistsin transacting with rather than representing nature, that articulatelanguage rests on a deep bed of shared human practices that can neverbe fully ‘made explicit’. , Pragmatism originated in the United States around 1870, and nowpresents a growing third alternative to both analytic and‘Continental’ philosophical traditions worldwide. Itsfirst generation was initiated by the so-called ‘classicalpragmatists’ Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), who firstdefined and defended the view, and his close friend and {colleagueWilliam} James (1842–1910), who further developed and ablypopularized it. During this initial period, pragmatists focusedsignificantly on theorising inquiry, meaning and the nature of truth,although James put these themes to work exploring truth in religion. Asecond (still termed ‘classical’) generation turnedpragmatist philosophy more explicitly towards politics, education andother dimensions of social improvement, under the immense influence {ofJohn} Dewey (1859–1952) and his friend Jane Addams(1860–1935) – who invented the profession of social workas an expression of pragmatist ideas (and was awarded the Nobel {PeacePrize} in 1931). Also of considerable importance at this time {wasGeorge} Herbert Mead (1863–1931), who contributed significantlyto the social sciences, developing pragmatist perspectives upon therelations between the self and the community (Mead 1934). As theresulting progressive Deweyan ‘New Deal’ era passed awayand the {US} moved into the Cold War, pragmatism’s influence waschallenged, as analytic philosophy blossomed and became the dominantmethodological orientation in most Anglo-American philosophydepartments.  Transitional or ‘third generation’ figuresincluded C.I. Lewis and W.V.O. Quine; although these philosophersdeveloped a number of pragmatist themes, their analytic allegiance maybe seen in their significant focus on theory of knowledge as firstphilosophy (which Dewey deprecated as ‘the epistemologicalindustry’)., Following this dip in popularity, since the 1970s the pragmatisttradition has undergone a significant revival. Richard Rorty(1931–2007) turned consciously to pragmatism to rectify what he saw as mainstream epistemology’s crucial mistake: naively conceiving oflanguage and thought as ‘mirroring’ the world.Rorty’s bold and iconoclastic attacks on this‘representationalism’ birthed a so-calledneopragmatism to which a number of influential recentphilosophers have contributed (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Robert Brandom {andHuw} Price). Other pragmatists have objected to Rorty’s blithedismissal of truth as a topic better left undiscussed (Rorty 1982),and have sought to rehabilitate classical pragmatist ideals ofobjectivity (e.g. Susan Haack, Christopher Hookway and Cheryl Misak).These philosophers are now sometimes referred to as {NewPragmatists}. Yet others have worked to place pragmatist ideas in abroader Western philosophical context, for instance {tracingPeirce}’s significant debt to Kant (Apel 1974, Gava 2014), andconnections between pragmatism and 19th century idealism (Margolis2010, Stern 2009). Meanwhile, classical pragmatism’s progressivesocial ideals lived on in some quarters, with notable contributions tophilosophy of race made by Cornel West, who advanced a propheticpragmatism drawing on both Christian and Marxian thought (e.g.West 1989). A number of other liberatory philosophical projects inareas such as feminism (Seigfried 1996), ecology (Alexander 2013),Native American philosophy (Pratt 2002) and Latin American philosophy(Pappas 1998) also currently look to the pragmatist tradition as theirphilosophical home. , Meanwhile, increasingly pragmatism’s intellectual centre ofgravity is moving out of North America, with vibrant research networksappearing in South America, Scandinavia and more recently {centralEurope} and China. , The core of pragmatism as Peirce originally conceived it was {thePragmatic} Maxim, a rule for clarifying the meaning of hypotheses bytracing their ‘practical consequences’ – theirimplications for experience in specific situations. For Peirce {andJames}, a key application of the Maxim was clarifying the conceptof truth. This produced a distinctive epistemological outlook:a fallibilist, anti-Cartesian explication of the norms that governinquiry. Within that broad outlook, though, early pragmatists splitsignificantly over questions of realism broadly conceived– essentially, whether pragmatism should conceive itself as ascientific philosophy holding monism about truth (following Peirce),or a more broad-based alethic pluralism (following James {andDewey}). This dispute was poignantly emblematized in arguments {betweenPeirce} and James which led Peirce to rename hisview pragmaticism, presenting this clarified viewpoint to theworld as his new ‘baby’ which was, he hoped, ‘uglyenough to be safe from kidnappers’ ({EP}2: 355)., The first part of this entry is devoted to the classicalpragmatists’ distinctive methods, and how they give rise to anoriginal a posteriori epistemology. After that we will briefly exploresome of the many other areas of philosophy in which rich pragmatistcontributions have been made.},

In this article, we explore three theoretical perspectives that inform the development of such instructional materials. In our team’s efforts to develop a game-based learning applet for an existing inquiry-oriented curriculum, we have sought to theoretically frame our approach so that we can draw on the corpus of researcher knowledge from multiple disciplines. Accordingly, we will discuss three bodies of literature – realistic mathematics education’s [{RME}’s] approach to curriculum development, inquiry-oriented instruction and inquiry-based learning [{IO}/{IBL}], and game-based learning [{GBL}] - and draw on parallels across the three in order to form a coherent approach to developing digital games that draw on expertise in each field.},

	title = {Cognitive and Affective Components of Undergraduate Students Learning How to Prove},
	abstract = {Students struggle with proving, a fundamental activity in upper-level undergraduate mathematics courses. Learning how to prove is a difficult transition for students, as they shift from largely computation-based to argument-based work. In response, mathematics departments have instituted courses, introduction or transition to proof, designed to help students learn how to prove. Existing research has extensively examined students' errors, struggles, and some of their strategies at a given point in time, but we know little about students' development over a longer period of time. There is a need for longitudinal work in this area, to follow students through the transition to proof. In addition, little is known about the affective side of proving (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, emotions). Affect plays a central role in mathematics learning, influencing students' cognitive processes while problem solving and their motivation to value and want to do mathematics. Understanding affective issues are important, as students consider their future participation in mathematical work and communities. Positive experiences at transitional junctions, such as learning how to prove, are crucial for retention of students through the {STEM} (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) pipeline. The purpose of this work was to explore the cognitive and affective factors involved in undergraduates' efforts to learn how to prove: how their proving developed during a transition to proof course and what kinds of "satisfying moments," i.e. positive emotional reactions, they experienced. Four semi-structured interviews across a semester were conducted with eleven undergraduate students enrolled in a transition to proof course. The resulting data was analyzed using qualitative methods. Findings indicate that students showed growth in fluency, strategy use, and monitoring and judgement over time. Four developments were frequently observed across the sample: (1) increased sophistication in students' rationales for choice of proof techniques, (2) awareness about how a solution attempt was going and managing that for their subsequent strategies, (3) intentional exploring and monitoring when unsure about what direction to pursue, and (4) checking examples in conjunction with other strategies as a way to become unstuck. The variety of developments--and the different ways in which they emerged--is significant, because it confirms that multiple developments occur in different ways, strongly suggesting that there is no one path that students take through the transition to proof. Students' satisfying moments were largely about accomplishments both with and without struggle, understanding, external validation, as well as interacting with others. A theory for how satisfying moments are elicited was proposed. Expectations and a sense of mastery played large roles in mediating satisfying moments, but students' desire for understanding and sense-making was also prominent. This work provides guidance for curriculum design of transition to proof courses, in considering how to support students' development in proving. In addition, examination of just what makes a satisfying moment satisfying is helpful in thinking about how to construct mathematical tasks with opportunities for positive experiences with math.

	abstract = {First released in the Spring of 1999, How People Learn has been expanded to show how the theories and insights from the original book can translate into actions and practice, now making a real connection between classroom activities and learning behavior. This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning.

Like the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?  New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.

How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system.

Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.},

This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose "cognitive apprenticeship" (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.]},

This paper argues that part of the connection is rhetorical. Quantitative methods express the assumptions of a positvisit paradigm which holds that behavior can be explained through objective facts. Design and instrumentation persuade by showing how bias and error are eliminated. Qualitative methods express the assumptions of a phenomenological paradigm that there are multiple realities that are socially defined. Rich description persuades by showing that the researcher was immersed in the setting and giving the reader enough detail to ?make sense? of the situation. While rhetorically different, the results of the two methodologies can be complementary. Examples are drawn from two studies using different methodologies to study the same problem.},

Since related empirical research is limited in investigating the effects of using free mobile {AR} apps integrating Keller’s {ARCS} (attention-relevance-confidence-satisfaction) motivation model on learning motivation, anxiety, and outcomes between students with different levels of anxiety in primary math education, this study investigated whether mobile {AR} differently affected learning, motivation, and math anxiety between students with high and low anxiety. The results showed that the {AR} group performed better than the non-{AR} group, and high-anxiety learners in the {AR} group outperformed in algebra and geometry. The {AR} group had higher motivation based on Keller’s {ARCS} model. The highanxiety learners had higher confidence and satisfaction and lower anxiety when learning using mobile {AR}. The {AR} users were satisfied with ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, and benefit from exploration and hands-on experiences. Moreover, highanxiety users in the {AR} group had higher perceptions of exploration, hands-on experiences, and playfulness.

Awareness of knowledge gaps was consistently associated with greater science interest and to choosing tickets to a science museum over tickets to an art museum (Study 1b). These eﬀects were not consistently observed on, nor moderated by, other measures related to cognition, religion, and spirituality. However, exploratory analyses showed that science interest was better predicted by positive emotions than by awe. Still, these results provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence of awe as an “epistemic emotion” by demonstrating its eﬀects on awareness of knowledge gaps. These ﬁndings are also extended to the eﬀects of awe on science interest as one possible outcome of awareness of knowledge gaps.},

Our overarching purpose in this chapter is to explicate challenges that teachers must manage in putting into practice certain forms of classroom discourse. We focus on these challenges to (a) shed light on what it takes to successfully implement classroom discussion, and (b) inform researchers who need to understand these dimensions to design and interpret research on classroom instruction. We selectively review some strands of the literature on classroom discourse to describe a set of dimensions that we think are important for teacher practice and development, and for researchers who seek to better understand certain forms of classroom discourse.},

	abstract = {Social robots hold great promise as companions and peer-learners for children, yet little is known about how they can be best designed for this population, what interaction scenarios can benefit from their use, and how they might fit into learning activities and environments. We aim to close this gap by designing a learning-companion robot to augment guided reading activity and examine the robot’s impact on an in-home reading experience. In this paper, we compare the experiences of early adolescent children aged 10 to 12 (N = 24) who either completed guided reading activities with a learning-companion robot or as a paper-based activity in a two-week long, in-home field study. We found similar reading frequency and duration in both conditions and that both guided reading activities were described as positive experiences that help build reading skill and sustain engagement. Children who read with the learning-companion robot further reported that the activities supported reading comprehension and motivated them to read and indicated a deepening social connection (i.e., companionship or affiliation) with the robot. We conclude that rather than the activity falling off after a novelty effect, our simple prototype social robot is capable of preserving the benefits of an existing in-home learning activity while transforming the reading experience into a valuable, social one. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how we might capitalize on the capacity of social robots to serve as a transformative learning tool as robots become more widely available to the public.},

According to our studies in vocational schools, paper-based interfaces have the potential of making educational workflows tangible, i.e. both visible and manipulable. Our studies in university classes converge on minimalism: they reveal the effectiveness o tools that make visible what is invisible but do not analyze, predict or decide for teachers. These studies revealed a third circle of usability. The first circle concerns individual usability ({HCI}). The second circle is about design for teams ({CSCL}/{CSCW}). The third circle raises design choices that impart visibility, reification and minimalism on classroom orchestration. The fact that a {CSCL} environment allows or not students to look at what the next team is doing (e.g. tabletops versus desktops) illustrates the third circle issues that are important for orchestration.},

Vulnerable populations are at risk of experiencing inequalities in health experiences and health outcomes, and research beneﬁcial to those being researched is crucial to address disparities. Often vulnerable populations are exposed to research that is driven by dominant epistemologies, research methodologies, and socio-cultural lenses that can exacerbate their vulnerability, negating their socio-cultural reality. In this paper it is contended that researchers should review the way in which research is constructed and developed by creating a culturally safe space for research to occur with those who are vulnerable. A framework based on partnership, participation, protection, and power is presented as a way of creating culturally safe research.},

Taking an opposite stand, this article will argue that it is in fact unethical not to research vulnerable populations because, by excluding potential participants from research endeavours, they are being deprived of the benefits to be gained from research. Albeit well meaning, people in vulnerable populations are also being subjected to the paternalistic attitudes of those who believe they know what is in the best interests of others. There is ample evidence in existing literature that, not only is research among vulnerable populations unlikely to result in harm, but there are often benefits to be gained by both participants and researchers. Apart from the generic benefits of increased knowledge and improved health interventions, specific benefits for participants might be: therapeutic, cathartic, educational, empowering, altruistic and social. In contrast, the risks associated with researching vulnerable populations appear to be minimal. Yet, there is still evidence that health care professionals and other gatekeepers continue to hinder research amongst vulnerable populations through unilateral decision-making. This article will review existing literature on the topic of research amongst vulnerable populations, as well as contribute to the argument from the author’s own study on a sensitive topic.},

	abstract = {K-12 classroom settings are not yet incorporating emerging technologies such as ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, nor even touch surfaces, despite the significant impact that such media have made in many other aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, classroom environments have not generally evolved to support students in the new modes of collaboration, idea sharing, and inquiry that characterize many of our research-based innovations. Responding to this challenge, our research was conducted by a multi-disciplinary design team including educational researchers, a high school physics teacher, and technology designers. We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students’ physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry. One important outcome of this work is a set of design principles for supporting smart classroom research.},

Twenty five objects and videos were prepared and tested by a focus group. Their suggestions were incorporated into a pilot test at a residential school for the Deaf. Four fifth grade students participated in a usability study. Results were mixed with researchers observing successful use of Google Glass by all participants along with enthusiastic engagement, but also recording a lengthy learning curve and hardware issues that distracted from the learning process. Wearable augmented reality is still in its infancy, but potential was demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality represents an emerging technology, which can be successfully used to develop training tools in many domains, such as military, space, education or healthcare. The current paper proposes a training strategy for a sensory substitution device in order to improve the ability of visually impaired people to be autonomous, thus to increase the quality of their lives. The core of the strategy is a highly interactive virtual training environment, composed of 3D scenes simulating both realistic and imaginary settings. The training is based on gamification principles, as the virtual environment is designed as a highly immersive serious game, with essential elements such as quests, rewards or increasing complexity of tasks which can maintain its users motivated and help them acquire useful day-to-day life skills. Also, a series of mini-games are available in the training environment, as repetitive actions can facilitate the improvement of specific skills. By using appropriate hardware equipment, the virtual training environment can be rendered to the visually impaired users through acoustic and haptic means. The paper presents our proposed training strategy based on virtual reality in the context of numerous challenges of offering efficient training experiences to users with special needs.},

This is especially unfortunate as such environments hold great potential for them for uses such as social interaction, online education and especially for use with familiarizing the visually impaired user with a real environment virtually from the comfort and safety of his own home before visiting it in the real world. We have implemented a simple algorithm to improve this situation using single-point depth information, enabling the blind to use a virtual cane, modeled on the “{EyeCane}” electronic travel aid, within any virtual environment with minimal preprocessing. Use of the Virtual-{EyeCane}, enables this experience to potentially be later used in real world environments with identical stimuli to those from the virtual environment. We show the fast-learned practical use of this algorithm for navigation in simple environments.},

First, we re-present a paper given at a conference on the performing arts of people with ‘learning dif culties’, where the audience was made up of performers, workers, providers and researchers. This paper attempted to be accessible, theoretical, political and practical. Secondly, we re ect upon this paper in relation to seven points of analysis that emerge at the boundaries of disability politics and disability research. We argue throughout that real efforts must be made to bridge these boundaries in ways that augment disability theory and politics together.},

Based on the experience of doing research commissioned by organisations of disabled people and other work carried out within a framework of `user's perspectives' on services and policy, the discussion focuses on the lessons we have learnt-and those we still need to learn-about how to change the relations of research production. Consultation between researchers and disabled people, subjecting research to critical scrutiny, and making researchers accountable to disabled people are suggested as key issues in the development of participatory research .},

A learner's gestures can index moments of conceptual instability, and teachers can make use of those gestures to gain access into a student's thinking. Learners can also discover novel ideas from the gestures they produce during a lesson, or from the gestures they see their teachers produce. Gesture thus has the power not only to reflect a learner's understanding of a problem, but also to change that understanding.

Within the theoretical framework of human information processing, different types of processes underlying verbalization are discussed, and a model is presented of how Ss, in response to an instruction to think aloud, verbalize information that they are attending to in short-term memory ({STM}). Verbalizing information is shown to affect cognitive processes only if the instructions require verbalization of information that would not otherwise be attended to. From an analysis of what would be in {STM} at the time of report, the model predicts what could be reliably reported. The inaccurate reports found by other research are shown to result from requesting information that was never directly heeded, thus forcing Ss to infer rather than remember their mental processes.

	abstract = {This study was designed to better understand how new chemistry graduate students develop a teaching identity as {GTAs}. Specifically, this study considered two cases of first year chemistry graduate students engaging in teaching for the first time. Data sources included interviews, journals, classroom observations, and artifact ion collection. Classroom observations were used to describe the practices of the {GTAs} and when combined with the journals and interviews were used to develop an understanding of their identity development. The findings from the two cases produced descriptions of teaching practice, learning
environment factors that mediated the {GTA} teaching practices, and two different models of teaching identity for the new {GTAs}. Both {GTAs} began teaching with models of teaching identity drawn from their own experiences as students. In Case 1, the {GTA}’s model of teaching identity was labeled as helper. In Case 2, the {GTA}’s model of teaching identity was labeled as leader. I found that the discourse between the students and {GTAs} did not directly have evidence
of teaching identity. In a chemistry classroom, the {GTA}-student talk is centered on atoms, molecules, and reactions. I found evidence for understanding metapragmatic models of teaching identity in teaching practices and their interaction with learning environment factors. Five learning environment factors were identified in this study: Content, Worksheet structure, Mode of Instruction, Social interactions, and {GTA} observations. The description of the learning environment factors has methodological implications for expanding the usefulness of the Communities of Practice and Social Identification frameworks. In addition, learning environment factors and {GTA} teaching identity should be considered when developing training and
professional development for graduate students.},

	abstract = {Teacher education programs typically teach novices about one part of teaching at a time. We might offer courses on different topics—cultural foundations, learning theory, or classroom management—or we may parse teaching practice itself into a set of discrete techniques, such as core teaching practices, that can be taught individually. Missing from our courses is attention to the ultimate purpose of these discrete parts—how specific concepts can help teachers achieve their goals, or how specific procedures can help them achieve their goals. Because we are now shifting from a focus on bodies of knowledge to a focus on depictions of practice, this article examines our efforts to parse teaching practice into lists of discrete procedures. It argues that we need to pay less attention to the visible behaviors of teaching and more attention to the purposes that are served by those behaviors. As a way to begin a conversation about parsing teachers’ purposes, I offer a proposal for conceptualizing teaching as a practice that entails five persistent problems, each of which presents a difficult challenge to teachers, and all of which compete for teachers’ attention. Viewed in this way, the role of teacher education is not to offer solutions to these problems, but instead to help novices learn to analyze these problems and to evaluate alternative courses of action for how well they address these problems.},

We explore this potential through a synthesis of two case studies that investigated different approaches to supporting teacher reﬂection on practice through the use of video-stimulated recall: one case involved a single researcher and a single teacher, and the other case included two researchers working with a pair of teachers. Data were analysed through the use of two conceptual lenses which were synthesised from literature related to levels of teacher reﬂection and teacher change. The analysis suggests that video-stimulated recall can be an effective medium for promoting teacher professional learning, providing quality reﬂection and questioning are included as crucial elements of the processes.},

Learners are expected to articulate, develop, and defend their ideas and respond to the ideas of others. Decades of prior research have carefully documented features, processes, and potential benefits and shortcomings of an emphasis on talk in science learning. Yet, the task of documenting change in learners’ talk over time remains a major methodological challenge. To address this challenge, we examine one Korean immigrant girl’s (Selena) oral participation during an informal science learning program called Science Club. Quantitative analysis showed that, over time, Selena spoke more often and for longer. However, fine‐grained qualitative analysis of features of her talk (e.g., use of a variety of bids and hedges) demonstrated Selena’s persistent desire to share ideas, even though the intellectual merits of those ideas went largely unacknowledged. Methodologically, Selena’s case illustrates the importance of considering multiple features of learner talk, understood in the social context, when making claims about changes in oral participation over time. Pedagogically, Selena’s case highlights the importance of teachers’ attention to how learners’ ideas are taken up, in addition to how frequently they are speaking in class.},

The chapter also considers the potential of drawing as an activity to increase student engagement with the epistemic practices in science to promote deep learning and interest.

	abstract = {Two studies addressed student metacognition in math, measuring conﬁdence accuracy about math performance. Underconﬁdence would be expected in light of pervasive math anxiety. However, one might alternatively expect overconﬁdence based on previous results showing overconﬁdence in other subject domains. Metacognitive judgments and performance were assessed for biology, literature, and mathematics tests. In Study 1, high school students took three different tests and provided estimates of their performance both before and after taking each test. In Study 2, undergraduates similarly took three shortened {SAT} {II} Subject Tests. Students were overconﬁdent in predicting math performance, indeed showing greater overconﬁdence compared to other academic subjects. It appears that both overconﬁdence and anxiety can adversely affect metacognitive ability and can lead to math avoidance. The results have implications for educational practice and other environments that require extensive use of math.},

Additionally, we identified which math beliefs (and which theory) best explained variance in math behaviors and performance by college students and which students were most likely to have problematic math beliefs. Study participants included 368 college math students who completed questionnaires to report math behaviors (attending class, doing homework, reading textbooks, asking for help) and used a 5-point rating scale to indicate a variety of math beliefs. For a subset of 84 students, math professors provided final math grades. Factor analyses produced a 10-item Math Value Scale with 2 subscales (Class Devaluation, No Future Value), a 7-item single-dimension Math Confidence Scale, and an 11-item Math Barriers Scale with 2 subscales (Math Anxiety, Discouraging Words). Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that high levels of the newly discovered class devaluation belief (guided by expectancy-value theory) were most consistently associated with poor math behaviors in college students, with high math anxiety (guided by health belief model) and low math confidence (guided by self-efficacy theory) also found to be significant. Analyses of covariance revealed that younger and male students were at increased risk for class devaluation and older students were at increased risk for poor math confidence.},

The traditional college classroom design is based on the educational space that ﬁrst appeared in medieval universities. Since then classrooms have not changed except in their size. In an attempt to develop a different perspective of educational environment, a new design of classroom, the active learning classroom ({ALC}), was established at {SoongSil} University in Korea. Two questionnaire surveys were conducted for diagnosing the educational effects of students’ learning in the {ALC} and comparing the results with those obtained regarding the traditional classroom. The result proved the existence of a ‘golden zone’ and a ‘shadow zone’ in the traditional classroom, which discriminate students’ learning experiences depending on seating positions. On the contrary, the {ALC} did not produce such positional discrimination. Students perceived the {ALC} environment as more inspirational, especially in regards to active class participation. Students with more emphasis on academic achievement showed greater tendency to share information and to create new ideas in the {ALC}. However, in the traditional classroom setting, only students with high {GPAs} were more motivated to learn while the gap in learning attitudes was offset in the {ALC} setting. In-depth discussions about research ﬁndings were undertaken and four suggestions were provided in support of school administrators and relevant institutional personnel, faculty members, and researchers for future utilization of the {ALC}.},

Results indicate that gender differences in math confidence are larger than disparities in interest and achievement in elementary school. Structural equation models show that math performance is a consistent predictor of later confidence and interest, and there is some evidence for a reciprocal relation between confidence and performance in middle school. Relations were generally similar for boys and girls. Results raise questions about the notion that early gender differences in math interest are a driver of disparities in later math outcomes and instead suggest that math interventions for girls should begin early and include attention to math confidence, in addition to achievement.},

We compare student performance in traditional and active learning classrooms in a large, introductory biology course using the same syllabus, course goals, exams, and instructor. Using {ACT} scores as predictive, we found that students in the active learning classroom outperformed expectations, whereas those in the traditional classroom did not. By replicating initial work, our results provide empirical confirmation that new, technology-enhanced learning environments positively and independently affect student learning. Our data suggest that creating space for active learning can improve student performance in science courses. However, we recognize that such a commitment of resources is impractical for many institutions, and we offer recommendations for applying what we have learned to more traditional spaces.

In addition, moderator analyses were mixed in terms of statistical significance and explored effect‐size heterogeneity across effects using grade level, instrument type, length of game‐based intervention, country, publication type, and study year characteristics.

	abstract = {The recent appearance of low cost virtual reality ({VR}) technologies – like the Oculus Rift, the {HTC} Vive and the Sony {PlayStation} {VR} – and Mixed Reality Interfaces ({MRITF}) –like the Hololens – is attracting the attention of users and researchers suggesting it may be the next largest stepping stone in technological innovation. However, the history of {VR} technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of {VR} was formulated in the 1960s and the ﬁrst commercial {VR} tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientiﬁc papers. What is the outcome of this signiﬁcant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the ﬁeld. We collected all the existent articles about {VR} in the Web of Science Core Collection scientiﬁc database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for {VR} and 9,944 for augmented reality ({AR}). The bibliographic record contained various ﬁelds, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on {VR} concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at ﬁrst computer science was the leading research ﬁeld, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in {VR} research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of {VR} in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected {VR}’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that {VR}/{AR}/{MRITF} will be able to get in scientiﬁc ﬁelds, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientiﬁc applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.},

	abstract = {In light of the increasing technological developments, working life and education is changing and becoming more complex, interconnected and digital. These changed circumstances require new and modified competences of future employees. Education has to respond to the changing requirements in working life. To prepare for this, a technological-oriented teaching and learning process as well as gaining practical experience is crucial for students. In this context, Virtual Reality ({VR}) technologies provide new opportunities for practical experience in higher education, where they can further intensify the students learning experiences to a more immersive and engaging involvement in the learning process. To evaluate the potential of immersive virtual learning environments ({VLE}) for higher education and to understand more deeply which kind of experiences students gain while learning in immersive virtual environments ({VE}) an experimental research study is carried out. The paper describes education in light of industry 4.0 first and gives an overall view of immersive learning and the role of {VR} Technologies. Then the user study to measure user experience ({UX}) in immersive {VLE} is presented. Preliminary results are outlined and discussed with a view of further research.},

The overt learning experience is based in the design questions deﬁned and the subtle experience was derived by examining the idea of sense of place as it relates to the virtual environment.

	abstract = {Augmented Reality ({AR}) is recognized as one of the most important developments in educational technology for both higher and K-12 education as emphasized in Horizon report (Johnson et al., 2016, 2015). Furthermore, {AR} is expected to achieve widespread adoption that will take two to three years in higher education and four to five years in K-12 education (Johnson et al., 2016, 2012). If this is the current state of the art for the use of {AR} in education, it is important to investigate how educators and researchers integrate {AR} into teaching-learning processes. Looking from such a glimpse, the purpose of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant research regarding the emergence of augmented reality, the links to pedagogy and educational outcomes, specifically in the context of formal education. The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework Arksey and O’Malley (2005). First, research questions are identified. Second, the last five years in {ERIC} database is explored by using the search term ‘augmented reality.’ Third, studies are investigated through inclusion and exclusion criteria, and {PRISMA} (2009) model is utilized for article selection. Fourth, selected articles are charted with respect to numerous dimensions and summaries. Finally, findings are reported in the light of research questions. The findings of the scoping review illustrated a set of studies that provide evidence of improved academic performance, increase in students’ engagement, motivation, and satisfaction through the educational environments that are enriched with {AR} applications. The findings of the scoping review are discussed with respect to multiple dimensions that are explored under research questions.},

	abstract = {So-called “design experiments” have been presented as a radical alternative to traditional experimental designs in behavioral sciences. A closer scrutiny of design experiments shows that they share the basic linear methodology of traditional randomized controlled trials, and thus ignore resistance and agency of learners as a source of surprise and novelty. Formative interventions based on Vygotsky’s principle of double stimulation offer an alternative that builds on and purposefully fosters learners’ agency. Formative interventions may be characterized with the help of an argumentative grammar which proposes (a) the collective activity system as a unit of analysis, (b) contradictions as a source of change and development, (c) agency as a crucial layer of causality, and (d) transformation of practice as a form of expansive concept formation. These four epistemic tenets are concretized with the help of analysis of data from a Change Laboratory formative experiment conducted in a Finnish hospital. The analysis shows that double stimulation is a multi-layered and longitudinal process in which both the initial problem situation (first stimulus) and the mediating conceptual tool (second stimulus) are reformulated and enriched in successive steps. Such a process of double stimulation generates a thirdness, a new concept for the activity under transformation.},

However, no significant differences were found in students’ confidence and satisfaction using V-transformation and also {GeoGebra} software. For overall motivation, the finding showed that there was a significant difference between the motivation of students using Vtransformation (M=3.78; {SD} = 0.403) as compared to the {GeoGebra} (M= 3.50; {SD}= 0.458; t(69)= 2.704, p=0.009). This finding suggested that technology could be used to motivate students in teaching and learning mathematics.},

This case study has been carried out with a view to replying the question of how we can make the subject of integers, which students in the 6th grades find too difficult to learn, easier and more permanent. The subject of Integers is one of the most difficult subjects that students have difficulty in grasping because they have only learnt natural numbers in Math. In general, when students come across a new number system, they have difficulty in learning it. Also, as they haven’t conceptualized the subject, they do not like the subject and cannot correlate the mathematical links. However, as teachers and mathematics educators, our duty is to make our students enjoy the subject of integers and ensure its retention. For this purpose, so as to eliminate the problems faced during the learning process, we have tried to conceptualize the subject by employing new software, Geogebra, by which we aim to provide a permanent learning for our students.},

	abstract = {Many research indicated that {ICT} has been proven useful as a tool in supporting and transforming teaching and learning. In mathematics classroom, {ICT} can help students and teachers to perform calculation, analyse data, explore mathematical concepts thus increasing the understanding in mathematics. This quasi-experimental study with non-equivalent control group post-test only design was conducted to examine the effects of using a free-software called {GeoGebra} in the learning of Coordinate Geometry among students classified as high visual-spatial ability students ({HV}) and low visual-spatial ability students ({LV}). The Spatial Visualization Ability Test Instrument ({SVATI}) had been used to categorize the students in different spatial ability level. A total of 53 secondary school students in Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur participated in the study. They were assigned into two different groups. One group was taught Coordinate Geometry using {GeoGebra} while the other underwent learning the traditional way. Students’ mathematics achievement was measured using post test at the end of the intervention. The test format was based on Additional Mathematics {KBSM} syllabus. Independent samples t-test results showed that there was a significant difference in mean mathematical achievement between the {GeoGebra} group (M=65.23, {SD}=19.202) and the traditional teaching strategy group (M=54.7, {SD}=15.660); [t (51) = 2.259, p= .028 {\textless} .05]. This study also found that the {HV} students performed better than the {LV} students in both group. Findings showed that there were no significant different among {HV} students between {GeoGebra} group and traditional group. Meanwhile the {LV} students in {GeoGebra} group (M=64.07, {SD}=21.569) significantly outperformed the {LV} students in traditional group (M=48.79, {SD}=15.106); [t (51) = 2.222, p= .036 {\textless} .05]. These findings showed that the use of {GeoGebra} enhanced the students’ performance in learning Coordinate Geometry.},

The research presented is part of a broader research project on improving high school students’ risk literacy and critical thinking. Decisions that involve the understanding of risk are made in all aspects of life including health (e.g. whether to continue with the course of medication), finances (paying for extra insurance) and politics (preemptive strikes versus political dialogue). These decisions are not only common, but they are also critical for individual and societal health and well being. Some studies have shown that people are routinely exposed to medical risk information and that their understanding of this information can have serious implications on their health. Despite its importance, most people are unable to adequately interpret and communicate risk. The goal of our research is to substantiate the claim that dynamic learning environment enables student to grasp abstract mathematical concept by manipulating mathematical objects constructed within these systems and implementing critical thinking skills.},

The participants in this study were 33 pre-service mathematics teachers. An open-ended questionnaire, knowledge test, tasks, and participants’ dynamic constructions were used as data collection tools. The analysis of participants’ products was based on descriptive analysis and Toulmin’s model. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the participants constructed the relationship between the concepts of differential and derivative as well as the concepts of tangent and slope by using them within the geometric framework. Due to the integration of {GeoGebra} and the {ACODESA} method, the participants explored the relationships among true change, estimated change, and error by using the geometric interpretation of the concept of differential. It was found that with this method, they deduced that Δx and dx were two different symbols for the same variable.},

This study takes a qualitative approach building on the work of a 13-year-old girl as an exemplary case of the nature of young students’ spontaneous mathematical problem solving with technology. The empirical data comprise digital records of her approaches to two problems from a web-based mathematical competition where she resorted to {GeoGebra} and an interview where she explains and describes her usual problem solving activity with this tool. Based on a proposed model for describing the processes of mathematical problem solving with technologies ({MPST}), the main results show that this student’s solving and expressing the solution are held from the early and continuing interplay between mathematical skills and the perception of the affordances of the tool. The analytical model offers a clear picture of the type of actions that lead to the solution of each problem, revealing the student’s ability to deal with mathematics and technology in problem solving. By acknowledging this as a case of a human-withmedia in solving mathematical problems, the students’ efficient way of merging technological and mathematical knowledge is portrayed in terms of her technomathematical fluency.},

The experimental study was conducted on 80 Form Two students, 40 of whom comprised the treatment group and 40 formed the control group. Data were analysed using the software {ANATES} 4 and {SPSS} 24.0. Significant differences were found in student achievements in relation to the topics of functions and limit functions according to their group type. Research outcomes also showed that teachers and students approved the use of {GeoGebra} in the teaching and learning of mathematics. {GeoGebra} can illustrate mathematical concepts and procedures well through visuals and graphs, which considerably aid students in mastering and understanding concepts and procedures pertaining to functions and limit functions. This software is user-friendly and can relieve the teachers’ burden in explaining functions. Even though the use of {GeoGebra} is time consuming, teaching by using the software can render the students’ learning process increasingly active. Moreover, learning mathematics with the help of {GeoGebra} allows for an active interaction between teachers and students. This study provides suggestions as interventions for increasing student achievement.},

Informed by a Critical Disability Studies ideology, this dyadic interview technique has been adapted to address some of the difficulties that present when conducting interviews with individuals with intellectual disabilities. The interview structure consists of a dyad that includes the individual with intellectual disability and the person they identify as their key support person. Currently, researchers have embraced dyadic interviewing as a method of triangulation. However, it also has potential to be used as an important method of accommodation for people with intellectual disability that promotes choice and self-determination in research participation.},

	abstract = {This collection of writing has grown from the work of the National Black Disability Coalition, led by Jane Dunhamn and Leroy Moore. The Coalition met on June 7, 2013, in the historic Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, New Jersey to discuss the future of Black Disability Studies ({BDS}). Since that time, members of the Coalition have written an outline for a {BDS} course, presented at conferences, and developed strategies to incorporate {BDS} into the disciplines of Black Studies and Disability Studies. We have also reflected deeply on what the introduction of {BDS} will mean, both for Black Studies and for disability studies.Our writings in this collection are intended to mark the work of the National Black Disability Coalition thus far, but also to provide a platform from which further work in {BDS} can grow. By underscoring the development and potential of {BDS}, this article articulates the need for {BDS} within mainstream disability studies, and advocates for {BDS} not to be taken as a marginalized special-topic course, but rather to be engaged in every and at the heart of Disability Studies courses and pedagogies. Although we believe that {BDS} should be integrated into every Disability Studies course, we recognize that, like disability itself, it cannot simply be “added and stirred”; rather, the inclusion of {BDS} is a paradigm-shifting change. The pieces included in this collection are enactments of an ongoing conversation--a conversation that we hope the readers of Disability Studies Quarterly will join thoughtfully.The sections comprise statements from the leaders of the National Black Disability Coalition, Jane Dunhamn and Leroy Moore; reflective writings from three instructors and two students of Black Disability Studies; and a copy of the course outline.},

	abstract = {There are many reasons to be curious about the way people learn, and the past several decades have seen an explosion of research that has important implications for individual learning, schooling, workforce training, and policy.
In 2000, How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition was published and its influence has been wide and deep. The report summarized insights on the nature of learning in school-aged children; described principles for the design of effective learning environments; and provided examples of how that could be implemented in the classroom.
Since then, researchers have continued to investigate the nature of learning and have generated new findings related to the neurological processes involved in learning, individual and cultural variability related to learning, and educational technologies. In addition to expanding scientific understanding of the mechanisms of learning and how the brain adapts throughout the lifespan, there have been important discoveries about influences on learning, particularly sociocultural factors and the structure of learning environments.
How People Learn {II}: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures provides a much-needed update incorporating insights gained from this research over the past decade. The book expands on the foundation laid out in the 2000 report and takes an in-depth look at the constellation of influences that affect individual learning. How People Learn {II} will become an indispensable resource to understand learning throughout the lifespan for educators of students and adults.},
