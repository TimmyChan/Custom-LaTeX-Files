  abstract = {With rapid advances in social robotics, humanoids and autonomy, robot assistants appear to be within reach. However, robots are still unable to effectively interact with humans in activities of daily living. One of the challenges is in the frequent use of multiple communication modalities when humans engage in collaborative activities. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Interaction Manager, a framework for an assistive robot that maintains an active multimodal interaction with a human partner while performing physical collaborative tasks. The heart of our framework is a Hierarchical Bipartite ActionTransition Network (HBATN), which allows the robot to infer the state of the task and the dialogue given spoken utterances and observed pointing gestures from a human partner, and to plan its next actions. Finally, we implemented this framework on a robot to provide preliminary evidence that the robot can successfully participate in a task-oriented multimodal interaction.},

The study incorporated a pre-post approach that involved surveys to assess students‘ perceptions of psychosocial features of the learning environment, academic efficacy and students‘ enjoyment of mathematics lessons. A sample of 90 students from three colleges in the United Arab Emirates participated in the study. After the initial collection of quantitative data, Jeopardy!-type games were introduced to 90 students over a six-week period. The findings suggest that, during exposure to games, students experienced an improvement in the three psychosocial features of the learning environment (teacher support, involvement and personal relevance) and also academic efficacy and enjoyment of mathematics lessons. The results of this study offer potential opportunities for mathematics educators to incorporate the use of mathematical games in the curriculum as a practical way to improve classroom environments and students‘ attitudes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore the use of GeoGebra (as a visual dynamic tool) and critical thinking skills for supporting high school students’ understanding of probability, more specifically, understanding of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem. The research presented is part of a broader research project on improving high school students’ risk literacy and critical thinking. Decisions that involve the understanding of risk are made in all aspects of life including health (e.g. whether to continue with the course of medication), finances (paying for extra insurance) and politics (preemptive strikes versus political dialogue). These decisions are not only common, but they are also critical for individual and societal health and well being. Some studies have shown that people are routinely exposed to medical risk information and that their understanding of this information can have serious implications on their health. Despite its importance, most people are unable to adequately interpret and communicate risk. The goal of our research is to substantiate the claim that dynamic learning environment enables student to grasp abstract mathematical concept by manipulating mathematical objects constructed within these systems and implementing critical thinking skills.},

  abstract = {In the past, ethics committees and researchers have avoided research among vulnerable groups because of prevailing perceptions that such research is unethical and difficult. Taking an opposite stand, this article will argue that it is in fact unethical not to research vulnerable populations because, by excluding potential participants from research endeavours, they are being deprived of the benefits to be gained from research. Albeit well meaning, people in vulnerable populations are also being subjected to the paternalistic attitudes of those who believe they know what is in the best interests of others. There is ample evidence in existing literature that, not only is research among vulnerable populations unlikely to result in harm, but there are often benefits to be gained by both participants and researchers. Apart from the generic benefits of increased knowledge and improved health interventions, specific benefits for participants might be: therapeutic, cathartic, educational, empowering, altruistic and social. In contrast, the risks associated with researching vulnerable populations appear to be minimal. Yet, there is still evidence that health care professionals and other gatekeepers continue to hinder research amongst vulnerable populations through unilateral decision-making. This article will review existing literature on the topic of research amongst vulnerable populations, as well as contribute to the argument from the author’s own study on a sensitive topic.},

Vision based Gesture recognition has the potential to be a natural and powerful tool supporting efficient and intuitive interaction between the human and the computer. Visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for Human Computer Interaction (HCI). This has motivated many researchers in computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures as a very active research area. We surveyed the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in HCI and various seminal works of researchers are emphasized. The purpose of this review is to introduce the field of gesture recognition as a mechanism for interaction with computers.},

We present our process for developing equitable and instructionally supportive assessment tasks for multicultural students, resulting assessment tasks, and challenges associated with attending to cultural relevance (Ladson-Billings, 1995; 2014) in assessment design. We ask the question: “How can we achieve equity and fairness in the design of assessment tasks that incorporate tenets of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) without introducing construct irrelevant variance?” We present an equity and fairness assessment design framework and explore the infusion of CRP in our assessment design process to determine the extent to which culturally relevant pedagogy can be applied. This work is in response to the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), where teachers are faced with how to assess students from diverse backgrounds in science concepts, themes, and practices. Our design work is being carried out in the context of a multi-institutional collaborative, where we recognized a need for a clear and efficient approach to designing assessment tasks that can inform instruction in increasingly diverse classrooms.},

In this period of time, the total number of academic publications containing Baugmented reality\^ in the Web of Science database, in all indices, was determined as 3540, and among these publications, 58 articles with SSCI index were analyzed within the scope of the research. It analyzes the change of articles related to AR by years; the usage of methods and data collection tools; education field, educational advantages, the type of applications used, technologies, assets used, physical environments in which researches were carried out, sensory types that applications address to, countries and continents in which the articles were published, and the keywords in these articles. Findings obtained were visualized with tables and graphics. According to the results obtained from the findings, there has been a sudden increase in the number of publications since 2013 and it reached the highest level in 2016, the most commonly used method is the mixed method and the data collection tool is questionnaire, most of the studies are carried out in Science, tablets and smartphones are most used, AR applications address to visual sense mostly and such articles are published mostly in the Asian continent. It has been determined that the most positive effect of AR on education is for academic success and learning motivation. It has been understood that the AR is closely related to disciplines such as human-computer interaction, robotics and remote laboratory systems. In addition, some suggestions have been made to researchers and developers based on these research findings.},

Fortunately, for some discrete robots they are CAT(0) cubical complexes, a family of spaces with favorable properties.

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in applying Augmented Reality (AR) to create unique educational settings. So far, however, there is a lack of review studies with focus on investigating factors such as: the uses, advantages, limitations, effectiveness, challenges and features of augmented reality in educational settings. Personalization for promoting an inclusive learning using AR is also a growing area of interest. This paper reports a systematic review of literature on augmented reality in educational settings considering the factors mentioned before. In total, 32 studies published between 2003 and 2013 in 6 indexed journals were analyzed. The main findings from this review provide the current state of the art on research in AR in education. Furthermore, the paper discusses trends and the vision towards the future and opportunities for further research in augmented reality for educational settings.},

This paper looked into students’ motivation when using the V-Transformation courseware and an open source software, GeoGebra. The instrument used in this study was based on the ARCS model which consisted of attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction components. Finding showed that there was a significant difference in the students’ attention using V-Transformation (M=4.05, SD= .811) compared to using GeoGebra (M=3.66, SD= .445; t(69)=2.514, p=0.014). Significant difference also was identified for the relevance component after using the V-Transformation (M=3.89, SD= .609) and GeoGebra (M=3.52, SD= .559; t(69)=2.641, p=0.001). However, no significant differences were found in students’ confidence and satisfaction using V-transformation and also GeoGebra software. For overall motivation, the finding showed that there was a significant difference between the motivation of students using Vtransformation (M=3.78; SD = 0.403) as compared to the GeoGebra (M= 3.50; SD= 0.458; t(69)= 2.704, p=0.009). This finding suggested that technology could be used to motivate students in teaching and learning mathematics.},

In this article we focus specifically on clay making and the ways in which onto-epistemic heterogeneity can be engaged to create transformative maker spaces.

The second section discusses key elements of this approach including the problem of accountability, the social model of disability, choice of methods and, empowerment, dissemination and outcomes. The paper concludes by suggesting that whilst there has been considerable progress over the last decade the future of emancipatory disability research remains precarious.},

The results indicated that teachers commonly view video clips designed for immediate use rather than reflection and respond to videos by evaluating the pedagogy positively.

Researchers from marginalized communities often struggle to occupy the etic space of the academy and the emic space of their research. Using concepts of edgewalking and edgework, we argue that another space is available at the edge between emic and etic where transformative research can occur.},

The framework for cultural learning pathways is an application and elaboration of Ole Dreier’s theory of persons in diversities of structures of social practice with a focus on the learning of disciplinary practices and the development of discipline-related identities. We summarize relevant learning phenomena along extended cultural pathways from three team ethnographies of science learning. We outline how power-related issues associated with privilege and marginalization are attended to in relation to the social, cultural, and material circumstances of learning within and across environments and discuss future research opportunities.},

In carrying out the above, the Commission was directed to consider: (i) the boundaries between biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine practice of medicine, (ii) the role of assessment of risk-benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research involving human subjects, (iii) appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in such research and (iv) the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings.},

  abstract = {Background As the maker movement is increasingly adopted into K-12 schools, students are developing new competences in exploration and fabrication technologies. This study assesses learning with these technologies in K-12 makerspaces and FabLabs. Purpose Our study describes the iterative process of developing an assessment instrument for this new technological literacy, the Exploration and Fabrication Technologies Instrument, and presents findings from implementations at five schools in three countries. Our index is generalizable and psychometrically sound, and permits comparison between student confidence and performance. Design/Method Our evaluation of distinct technology skills separates general computing, information and communication technology (ICT), and exploration and fabrication technologies (EFTs) into nonoverlapping areas of technological expertise required to perform their respective sets of tasks. The instrument also tracks student confidence in EFT skills and assesses how that confidence relates to actual task performance. Results Exploration and fabrication technologies constitute a new and distinct set of technology literacies arising from fabrication settings. The EFT instrument compares students’ selfreported confidence with their performance on complex design tasks and demonstrates that, for students, exposure to general computing and ICT tools differs from exposure to EFT tools. Conclusion The EFT instrument captures a new and distinct set of technology literacies that arise within fabrication settings and are independent of both general computing and digital content production skills.},

  abstract = {Critical Theory has a narrow and a broad meaning in philosophy and inthe history of the social sciences. “Critical Theory” inthe narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophersand social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition knownas the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a“critical” theory may be distinguished from a“traditional” theory according to a specific practicalpurpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human“emancipation from slavery”, acts as a “liberating… influence”, and works “to create a world whichsatisfies the needs and powers” of human beings (Horkheimer1972, 246).  Because such theories aim to explain andtransform all the circumstances that enslave human beings,many “critical theories” in the broader sense have beendeveloped. They have emerged in connection with the many socialmovements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of humanbeings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses,however, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normativebases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasingfreedom in all their forms., Critical Theory in the narrow sense has had many different aspects andquite distinct historical phases that cross several generations, fromthe effective start of the Institute for Social Research in the years1929–1930, which saw the arrival of the Frankfurt Schoolphilosophers and an inaugural lecture by Horkheimer, to thepresent. Its distinctiveness as a philosophical approach that extendsto ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history is mostapparent when considered in light of the history of the philosophy ofthe social sciences. Critical Theorists have long sought todistinguish their aims, methods, theories, and forms of explanationfrom standard understandings in both the natural and the socialsciences. Instead, they have claimed that social inquiry ought tocombine rather than separate the poles of philosophy and the socialsciences: explanation and understanding, structure and agency,regularity and normativity.  Such an approach, Critical Theoristsargue, permits their enterprise to be practical in adistinctively moral (rather than instrumental) sense. They do notmerely seek to provide the means to achieve some independent goal, butrather (as in Horkheimer's famous definition mentioned above) seek“human emancipation” in circumstances of domination andoppression. This normative task cannot be accomplished apart from theinterplay between philosophy and social science throughinterdisciplinary empirical social research (Horkheimer 1993). WhileCritical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to theFrankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretchesto Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similarpractical aims could be called a “critical theory,”including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms ofpost-colonial criticism. In the following, Critical Theory whencapitalized refers only to the Frankfurt School. All other uses of theterm are meant in the broader sense and thus not capitalized. Whenused in the singular, “a critical theory” is notcapitalized, even when the theory is developed by members of theFrankfurt School in the context of their overall project of CriticalTheory., It follows from Horkheimer's definition that a critical theory isadequate only if it meets three criteria: it must be explanatory,practical, and normative, all at the same time. That is, it mustexplain what is wrong with current social reality, identify the actorsto change it, and provide both clear norms for criticism andachievable practical goals for social transformation. Any trulycritical theory of society, as Horkheimer further defined it in hiswritings as Director of the Frankfurt School's Institute for SocialResearch, “has as its object human beings as producers of theirown historical form of life” (Horkeimer 1993, 21). In light ofthe practical goal of identifying and overcoming all the circumstancesthat limit human freedom, the explanatory goal could be furthered onlythrough interdisciplinary research that includes psychological,cultural, and social dimensions, as well as institutional forms ofdomination. Given the emphasis among the first generation of CriticalTheory on human beings as the self-creating producers of their ownhistory, a unique practical aim of social inquiry suggests itself: totransform contemporary capitalism into a consensual form of sociallife. For Horkheimer a capitalist society could be transformed only bybecoming more democratic, to make it such that “all conditionsof social life that are controllable by human beings depend on realconsensus” in a rational society (Horkheimer 1972, 249–250). Thenormative orientation of Critical Theory, at least in its form ofcritical social inquiry, is therefore towards the transformation ofcapitalism into a “real democracy” in which such controlcould be exercised (Horkheimer 1972, 250). In such formulations, thereare striking similarities between Critical Theory and Americanpragmatism., The focus on democracy as the location for cooperative, practical andtransformative activity continues today in the work of JürgenHabermas, as does the attempt to determine the nature and limits of“real democracy” in complex, pluralistic, and globalizingsocieties., As might be expected from such an ambitious philosophical project andform of inquiry, Critical Theory is rife with tensions. In whatfollows I will develop the arguments within Critical Theory thatsurround its overall philosophical project. First, I explore its basicphilosophical orientation or metaphilosophy. In its efforts to combineempirical social inquiry and normative philosophical argumentation,Critical Theory presents a viable alternative for social and politicalphilosophy today. Second, I will consider its core normativetheory—its relation to its transformation of a Kantian ethics ofautonomy into a conception of freedom and justice in which democracyand democratic ideals play a central role (Horkheimer 1993, 22;Horkheimer 1972, 203). As a member of the second generation ofCritical Theory, Habermas in particular has developed this dimensionof normative political theory into a competitor to Rawlsianconstructivism, which attempts to bring our pretheoretical intuitionsinto reflective equilibrium. In the third section, I will consider itsempirical orientation in practical social theory and practical socialinquiry that aims at promoting democratic norms. A fundamental tensionemerges between a comprehensive social theory that provides atheoretical basis for social criticism and a more pluralist andpractical orientation that does not see any particular theory ormethodology as distinctive of Critical Theory as such. In this way,the unresolved tension between the empirical and normative aspects ofthe project of a critical theory oriented to the realization of humanfreedom is manifest in each of its main contributions to philosophyinformed by social science. Finally, I examine the contribution ofCritical Theory to debates about globalization, in which the potentialtransformation of both democratic ideals and institutions is atstake.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of enhanced anchored instruction (EAI) on students with and without MD in co-taught general education classrooms. Results showed that students in the EAI condition improved their performance on math skills contained in several of the standards. Effect sizes were especially large for students with MD when the special education teacher more actively participated in the instructional activities with the math teacher. Classroom observations provided examples of how teachers can work together to benefit students in inclusive math settings.},

  abstract = {Crime prevention is the professed mission o f every agency found within the American criminal justice system. In prac tice, the term "prevention" seems to be applied confusingly to a wide array of contradictory activities. This confusion can be avoided through the use of a conceptual model that defines three levels of prevention: (1) primary prevention, directed at modification of criminogenic conditions in the physical and social environment at large; (2) secondary prevention, directed at early identification and intervention in the lives of individuals or groups in criminogenic circumstances; and (3) tertiary prevention, directed at prevention of recidivism. The use of such a conceptual model helps to clarify current crime prevention efforts, suggests fruitful directions for future research by identifying current lacunae in practice and in the research literature, and may ultimately prove helpful in ad dressing the seemingly endless debate between advocates of "punishment " and advocates of "treatment."},

This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose "cognitive apprenticeship" (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.]},

This poset NPol(d) is a natural discrete counterpart of the continuum of convex compact sets in Rd , ordered by inclusion, and exhibits a remarkably rich combinatorial structure. We derive various arithmetic bounds on elementary relations in NPol(d), called quantum jumps. The existence of extremal objects in NPol(d) is a challenge of number theoretical flavor, leading to interesting classes of normal polytopes: minimal, maximal, spherical. Minimal elements in NPol(5) have played a critical role in disproving various covering conjectures for normal polytopes in the 1990s. Here we report on the first examples of maximal elements in NPol(4) and NPol(5), found by a combination of the developed theory, random generation, and extensive computer search.},

Informed by a Critical Disability Studies ideology, this dyadic interview technique has been adapted to address some of the difficulties that present when conducting interviews with individuals with intellectual disabilities. The interview structure consists of a dyad that includes the individual with intellectual disability and the person they identify as their key support person. Currently, researchers have embraced dyadic interviewing as a method of triangulation. However, it also has potential to be used as an important method of accommodation for people with intellectual disability that promotes choice and self-determination in research participation.},

  abstract = {Motivation and math anxiety are crucial in performance and satisfaction, and augmented reality (AR) may be a useful tool in enhancing these factors because it provides users with interesting visual experiences. Since related empirical research is limited in investigating the effects of using free mobile AR apps integrating Keller’s ARCS (attention-relevance-confidence-satisfaction) motivation model on learning motivation, anxiety, and outcomes between students with different levels of anxiety in primary math education, this study investigated whether mobile AR differently affected learning, motivation, and math anxiety between students with high and low anxiety. The results showed that the AR group performed better than the non-AR group, and high-anxiety learners in the AR group outperformed in algebra and geometry. The AR group had higher motivation based on Keller’s ARCS model. The highanxiety learners had higher confidence and satisfaction and lower anxiety when learning using mobile AR. The AR users were satisfied with ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, and benefit from exploration and hands-on experiences. Moreover, highanxiety users in the AR group had higher perceptions of exploration, hands-on experiences, and playfulness. This study includes the participants’ experience in adopting mobile AR for their learning and discusses its constraints.},

While proof is often used by mathematicians to justify that a theorem is true, many times proof is used for another purpose entirely such as to explain why a particular statement is true or to show mathematics students a particular proof technique. This paper reports on a study that used a form of inquiry-based learning (IBL) in an introduction to proof course and measured the beliefs of students in this course about the different functions of proof in mathematics as compared to students in a non-IBL course. It was found that undergraduate students in an introduction to proof course had a more robust understanding of the functions of proof than previous studies would suggest. Additionally, students in the course taught using inquiry pedagogy were more likely to appreciate the communication, intellectual challenge, and providing autonomy functions of proof. It is hypothesized that these results are a response to the pedagogy of the course and the types of student activity that were emphasized.},

  abstract = {The recent appearance of low cost virtual reality (VR) technologies – like the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and the Sony PlayStation VR – and Mixed Reality Interfaces (MRITF) –like the Hololens – is attracting the attention of users and researchers suggesting it may be the next largest stepping stone in technological innovation. However, the history of VR technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of VR was formulated in the 1960s and the first commercial VR tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the outcome of this significant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the field. We collected all the existent articles about VR in the Web of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for VR and 9,944 for augmented reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on VR concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at first computer science was the leading research field, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in VR research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected VR’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that VR/AR/MRITF will be able to get in scientific fields, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientific applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.},

Rather, they are constructed as policymakers and constituents interpret a particular aspect of the social world as problematic. How a policy problem is framed is important because it assigns responsibility and creates rationales that authorize some policy solutions and not others. This article brings together sense-making theory and frame analysis to understand the dynamics of problem framing during policy implementation. Data were derived from a yearlong ethnographic study of one school’s response to the California Reading Initiative. Results showed that the school’s response depended on how school staff constructed their understanding of the relevant problem to be solved. The problem framing process was iterative and contested, shaped by authority relations and mediated by teachers’ social networks. Ultimately, it proved important for motivating and coordinating action, reshaping authority relations, and influencing teachers’ beliefs and practices.},

We compare student performance in traditional and active learning classrooms in a large, introductory biology course using the same syllabus, course goals, exams, and instructor. Using ACT scores as predictive, we found that students in the active learning classroom outperformed expectations, whereas those in the traditional classroom did not. By replicating initial work, our results provide empirical confirmation that new, technology-enhanced learning environments positively and independently affect student learning. Our data suggest that creating space for active learning can improve student performance in science courses. However, we recognize that such a commitment of resources is impractical for many institutions, and we offer recommendations for applying what we have learned to more traditional spaces.

  abstract = {This paper examines the literature on identity within mathematics education published in journals over the past two decades. It analyses the theoretical underpinnings, research methods and definitions of identity, providing a critique rather than a summary of the literature. A total of 188 articles from 85 different journals are reviewed in the sample. This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.},

Literature shows that effective team learning requires the establishment of a dialogical space amongst team members, in which communicative behaviours such as ‘sharing’, ‘co-construction’ and ‘constructive conflict’ are balanced. However, finding this balance is not enough. Important questions such as ‘communicating about what?’, ‘communicating with whom?’ and ‘communicating for what?’ remain crucial. Five other process variables ‘team reflexivity’, ‘team activity’, ‘boundary crossing’, ‘storage’ and ‘retrieval’ are identified. Besides the core process variables, our model organises the most important inputs, catalyst emergent states and outputs of team learning.},

In this article, we explore three theoretical perspectives that inform the development of such instructional materials. In our team’s efforts to develop a game-based learning applet for an existing inquiry-oriented curriculum, we have sought to theoretically frame our approach so that we can draw on the corpus of researcher knowledge from multiple disciplines. Accordingly, we will discuss three bodies of literature – realistic mathematics education’s [RME’s] approach to curriculum development, inquiry-oriented instruction and inquiry-based learning [IO/IBL], and game-based learning [GBL] - and draw on parallels across the three in order to form a coherent approach to developing digital games that draw on expertise in each field.},

Our studies in university classes converge on minimalism: they reveal the effectiveness o tools that make visible what is invisible but do not analyze, predict or decide for teachers. These studies revealed a third circle of usability. The first circle concerns individual usability (HCI). The second circle is about design for teams (CSCL/CSCW). The third circle raises design choices that impart visibility, reification and minimalism on classroom orchestration. The fact that a CSCL environment allows or not students to look at what the next team is doing (e.g. tabletops versus desktops) illustrates the third circle issues that are important for orchestration.},

The current paper proposes a training strategy for a sensory substitution device in order to improve the ability of visually impaired people to be autonomous, thus to increase the quality of their lives. The core of the strategy is a highly interactive virtual training environment, composed of 3D scenes simulating both realistic and imaginary settings. The training is based on gamification principles, as the virtual environment is designed as a highly immersive serious game, with essential elements such as quests, rewards or increasing complexity of tasks which can maintain its users motivated and help them acquire useful day-to-day life skills. Also, a series of mini-games are available in the training environment, as repetitive actions can facilitate the improvement of specific skills. By using appropriate hardware equipment, the virtual training environment can be rendered to the visually impaired users through acoustic and haptic means. The paper presents our proposed training strategy based on virtual reality in the context of numerous challenges of offering efficient training experiences to users with special needs.},

The Coalition met on June 7, 2013, in the historic Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, New Jersey to discuss the future of Black Disability Studies (BDS). Since that time, members of the Coalition have written an outline for a BDS course, presented at conferences, and developed strategies to incorporate BDS into the disciplines of Black Studies and Disability Studies. We have also reflected deeply on what the introduction of BDS will mean, both for Black Studies and for disability studies.Our writings in this collection are intended to mark the work of the National Black Disability Coalition thus far, but also to provide a platform from which further work in BDS can grow. By underscoring the development and potential of BDS, this article articulates the need for BDS within mainstream disability studies, and advocates for BDS not to be taken as a marginalized special-topic course, but rather to be engaged in every and at the heart of Disability Studies courses and pedagogies. Although we believe that BDS should be integrated into every Disability Studies course, we recognize that, like disability itself, it cannot simply be “added and stirred”; rather, the inclusion of BDS is a paradigm-shifting change. The pieces included in this collection are enactments of an ongoing conversation--a conversation that we hope the readers of Disability Studies Quarterly will join thoughtfully.The sections comprise statements from the leaders of the National Black Disability Coalition, Jane Dunhamn and Leroy Moore; reflective writings from three instructors and two students of Black Disability Studies; and a copy of the course outline.},

We begin by discussing the limitations of reductive conceptions of disability. In so doing, we consider how far Bourdieu’s (1990) concept of habitus offers a way of bringing an analysis of the body to bear upon an understanding of the social inequalities which are core to the lives of disabled people. Through focus groups with disabled people, the article explores aspects of disabled people’s corporeal identities, feelings and (embodied) encounters in a range of social settings. The research shows that disabled people’s lives are connected to different ‘valuations’ attributed to corporeal forms, and to systems of signification and representation, which underpin them. We conclude by reaffirming the need to consider Bourdieu’s ideas in helping in the development of disability theory.},

Our goal is to produce a “comic book” summary, in which a transcript is augmented with keyframes that disambiguate and clarify accompanying text. Unlike most previous keyframe extraction systems which rely primarily on visual cues, we present a linguistically-motivated approach that selects keyframes that contain salient gestures. Rather than learning gesture salience directly, it is estimated by measuring the contribution of gesture to understanding other discourse phenomena. More specifically, we bootstrap from multimodal coreference resolution to identify gestures that improve performance. We then select keyframes that capture these gestures. Our model predicts gesture salience as a hidden variable in a conditional framework, with observable features from both the visual and textual modalities. This approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines that do not use gesture information.},

  abstract = {The substantial gender gap in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce can be traced back to the underrepresentation of women at various milestones in the career pathway. Calculus is a necessary step in this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing STEM fields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested in STEM and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking Calculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a STEM major or are dissuaded from STEM disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on mainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for academic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman being dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for a man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material well enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women and men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find women start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence than men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack of mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of women. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women in STEM at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that if women persisted in STEM at the same rate as men starting in Calculus I, the number of women entering the STEM workforce would increase by 75\%.},

In this, the second part of the study, we discuss attributes and implications of this mode of teaching/learning mathematics, also mentioning some of the benefits and concerns. Speculation about the future in such a fluid environment is both risky and fascinating but we nevertheless envisage some possible future trends.

  abstract = {So-called “design experiments” have been presented as a radical alternative to traditional experimental designs in behavioral sciences. A closer scrutiny of design experiments shows that they share the basic linear methodology of traditional randomized controlled trials, and thus ignore resistance and agency of learners as a source of surprise and novelty. Formative interventions based on Vygotsky’s principle of double stimulation offer an alternative that builds on and purposefully fosters learners’ agency. Formative interventions may be characterized with the help of an argumentative grammar which proposes (a) the collective activity system as a unit of analysis, (b) contradictions as a source of change and development, (c) agency as a crucial layer of causality, and (d) transformation of practice as a form of expansive concept formation. These four epistemic tenets are concretized with the help of analysis of data from a Change Laboratory formative experiment conducted in a Finnish hospital. The analysis shows that double stimulation is a multi-layered and longitudinal process in which both the initial problem situation (first stimulus) and the mediating conceptual tool (second stimulus) are reformulated and enriched in successive steps. Such a process of double stimulation generates a thirdness, a new concept for the activity under transformation.},

However, one might alternatively expect overconfidence based on previous results showing overconfidence in other subject domains. Metacognitive judgments and performance were assessed for biology, literature, and mathematics tests. In Study 1, high school students took three different tests and provided estimates of their performance both before and after taking each test. In Study 2, undergraduates similarly took three shortened SAT II Subject Tests. Students were overconfident in predicting math performance, indeed showing greater overconfidence compared to other academic subjects. It appears that both overconfidence and anxiety can adversely affect metacognitive ability and can lead to math avoidance. The results have implications for educational practice and other environments that require extensive use of math.},

Within the theoretical framework of human information processing, different types of processes underlying verbalization are discussed, and a model is presented of how Ss, in response to an instruction to think aloud, verbalize information that they are attending to in short-term memory (STM). Verbalizing information is shown to affect cognitive processes only if the instructions require verbalization of information that would not otherwise be attended to. From an analysis of what would be in STM at the time of report, the model predicts what could be reliably reported. The inaccurate reports found by other research are shown to result from requesting information that was never directly heeded, thus forcing Ss to infer rather than remember their mental processes.

The design and development process of the interactive print document is described in detail. Participants in the quasiexperimental study included 61 students and measures included the IMMS Survey as well as pre-, post-, and delayed-post-achievement tests. Findings support claims that technology use within a mathematics lesson increases student achievement, and augmented reality enhances student motivation to learn mathematics. However, analyzing the impact of technology use on student conceptual and technical use of mathematics shows varying outcomes emphasizing the need for continued exploration to determine the impact of technology use not only on overall mathematical achievement, but also on the specific type of mathematical activity, technical or conceptual.},

Design and instrumentation persuade by showing how bias and error are eliminated. Qualitative methods express the assumptions of a phenomenological paradigm that there are multiple realities that are socially defined. Rich description persuades by showing that the researcher was immersed in the setting and giving the reader enough detail to ?make sense? of the situation. While rhetorically different, the results of the two methodologies can be complementary. Examples are drawn from two studies using different methodologies to study the same problem.},

We adapted the construct of an example space and extended its application to the constructs of example neighborhood, methods of example construction, and the functions of examples. We explained how to use our new lens to analyze the collection of examples and non-examples that the students had access to. We then demonstrate our method by analyzing the collection of examples and non-examples of a mathematical group the professor of an abstract algebra class presented during lectures or assigned to students in problem sets or exams.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, the gamma function (represented by                         Γ                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Gamma \}   , the capital letter gamma from the Greek alphabet) is one commonly used extension of the factorial function to complex numbers. The gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers.  For any positive integer                         n                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle n\}   ,                        Γ         (         n         )         =         (         n         −         1         )         !                   .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Gamma (n)=(n-1)!\textbackslash{} .\}   Derived by Daniel Bernoulli, for complex numbers with a positive real part the gamma function is defined via a convergent improper integral:                        Γ         (         z         )         =                    ∫                        0                                   ∞                                        x                        z             −             1                                        e                        −             x                                      d         x         ,                            ℜ         (         z         )         {$>$}         0                   .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Gamma (z)=\textbackslash int \_\{0\}\^\{\textbackslash infty \}x\^\{z-1\}e\^\{-x\}\textbackslash,dx,\textbackslash{} \textbackslash qquad \textbackslash Re (z){$>$}0\textbackslash{} .\}   The gamma function then is defined as the analytic continuation of this integral function to a meromorphic function that is holomorphic in the whole complex plane except the non-positive integers, where the function has simple poles.  The gamma function has no zeroes, so the reciprocal gamma function                         1                    /                  Γ                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle 1/\textbackslash Gamma \}    is an entire function. In fact, the gamma function corresponds to the Mellin transform of the negative exponential function:                        Γ         (         z         )         =         \{                                 M                                        e                        −             x                             \}         (         z         )         .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Gamma (z)=\textbackslash\{\{\textbackslash mathcal \{M\}\}e\^\{-x\}\textbackslash\}(z).\}   Other extensions of the factorial function do exist, but the gamma function is the most popular and useful. It is a component in various probability-distribution functions, and as such it is applicable in the fields of probability and statistics, as well as combinatorics.},

  abstract = {With data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999, this study explores gender-related patterns in math attitudes and achievement. Following 7040 students from 3rd to 8th grades, we examined gender differences in math confidence, interest, and performance and examined relations among these variables over time. Results indicate that gender differences in math confidence are larger than disparities in interest and achievement in elementary school. Structural equation models show that math performance is a consistent predictor of later confidence and interest, and there is some evidence for a reciprocal relation between confidence and performance in middle school. Relations were generally similar for boys and girls. Results raise questions about the notion that early gender differences in math interest are a driver of disparities in later math outcomes and instead suggest that math interventions for girls should begin early and include attention to math confidence, in addition to achievement.},

We explore this potential through a synthesis of two case studies that investigated different approaches to supporting teacher reflection on practice through the use of video-stimulated recall: one case involved a single researcher and a single teacher, and the other case included two researchers working with a pair of teachers. Data were analysed through the use of two conceptual lenses which were synthesised from literature related to levels of teacher reflection and teacher change. The analysis suggests that video-stimulated recall can be an effective medium for promoting teacher professional learning, providing quality reflection and questioning are included as crucial elements of the processes.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the academy and the disability movement is a problematic one. Disability researchers based in the academic world who align themselves with the social model of disability face contradictory aims and values in attempting to challenge dominant modes of research production in ways that signify the importance of the agendas of disabled people. It could be argued that research that involves people with the label of ‘learning dif culties’ [1] creates further points of contention. In this paper we do two things. First, we re-present a paper given at a conference on the performing arts of people with ‘learning dif culties’, where the audience was made up of performers, workers, providers and researchers. This paper attempted to be accessible, theoretical, political and practical. Secondly, we re ect upon this paper in relation to seven points of analysis that emerge at the boundaries of disability politics and disability research. We argue throughout that real efforts must be made to bridge these boundaries in ways that augment disability theory and politics together.},

Both the medical and economic definitions have relied primarily on clinical methods. Whereas the medical approach has been operationally measured by limits on major life activities, the economic orientation has been measured by restrictions on the amount or kind of work that can be performed. By contrast, the sociopolitical definition, which focuses on the interaction between the individual and the environment, can be empirically assessed by measures of visibility and labeling. Self-identification is also an important index of the relative size and political strength of disabled persons. Because of the significance of new antidiscrimination laws, which appear to be based on the minority-group model, there is a pressing need to grant operational measures of the sociopolitical definition a position of parity in relation to the vast amount of data that have already been accumulated through the use of medical and economic concepts in government and other surveys.},

Increasingly, those concerned with education policy and practice are shifting priorities toward supporting deeper learning by emphasizing the importance of students’ ability to apply knowledge in subject areas. Designers of student assessments are following suit and are taking on the challenge of creating a new generation of assessments. We present a principled approach for designing classroom-based assessments that not only assess deeper learning, but also provide teachers with critical information about how students are progressing toward achieving ambitious new learning goals. Our approach follows the evidentiary reasoning of evidence-centered design and builds on research about the important role of knowledge-in-use to support student learning. We illustrate our approach in the context of creating tasks that assess students’ science proficiency as reflected in the Next Generation Science Standards that are gaining prominence in the United States.},

Additionally, we identified which math beliefs (and which theory) best explained variance in math behaviors and performance by college students and which students were most likely to have problematic math beliefs. Study participants included 368 college math students who completed questionnaires to report math behaviors (attending class, doing homework, reading textbooks, asking for help) and used a 5-point rating scale to indicate a variety of math beliefs. For a subset of 84 students, math professors provided final math grades. Factor analyses produced a 10-item Math Value Scale with 2 subscales (Class Devaluation, No Future Value), a 7-item single-dimension Math Confidence Scale, and an 11-item Math Barriers Scale with 2 subscales (Math Anxiety, Discouraging Words). Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that high levels of the newly discovered class devaluation belief (guided by expectancy-value theory) were most consistently associated with poor math behaviors in college students, with high math anxiety (guided by health belief model) and low math confidence (guided by self-efficacy theory) also found to be significant. Analyses of covariance revealed that younger and male students were at increased risk for class devaluation and older students were at increased risk for poor math confidence.},

Different approaches have evolved, which can be best understood as a succession of policy paradigms emerging as responses to changing urban conditions: community organizing; tenant involvement; resource mobilization; community defense (both intentional organizing and environmental modification); preserving order; and protecting the vulnerable. Prevention in high-crime areas presents particular difficulties for community approaches. Community approaches have foundered mostly because of insufficient understanding of the nature of social relations within residential areas and of how community crime careers are shaped by the wider urban market.},

Cohen described an adaptation with less explicit competition suitable for undergraduate students at a liberal arts college. This article details an adaptation of this modified Moore method to teach mathematical statistics, and describes ways that such an approach helps engage students and foster the teaching of statistics. Groups of students worked a set of three difficult problems (some theoretical, some applied) every two weeks. Class time was devoted to coaching sessions with the instructor, group meeting time, and class presentations. R was used to estimate solutions empirically, where analytic results were intractable, as well as to provide an environment to undertake simulation studies with the aim of deepening understanding and complementing analytic solutions. Each group presented comprehensive solutions to complement oral presentations. Development of parallel techniques for empirical and analytic problem solving was an explicit goal of the course, which also attempted to communicate ways that statistics can be used to tackle interesting problems. The group problem-solving component and use of technology allowed students to attempt much more challenging questions than they could otherwise solve.

This study takes a qualitative approach building on the work of a 13-year-old girl as an exemplary case of the nature of young students’ spontaneous mathematical problem solving with technology. The empirical data comprise digital records of her approaches to two problems from a web-based mathematical competition where she resorted to GeoGebra and an interview where she explains and describes her usual problem solving activity with this tool. Based on a proposed model for describing the processes of mathematical problem solving with technologies (MPST), the main results show that this student’s solving and expressing the solution are held from the early and continuing interplay between mathematical skills and the perception of the affordances of the tool. The analytical model offers a clear picture of the type of actions that lead to the solution of each problem, revealing the student’s ability to deal with mathematics and technology in problem solving. By acknowledging this as a case of a human-withmedia in solving mathematical problems, the students’ efficient way of merging technological and mathematical knowledge is portrayed in terms of her technomathematical fluency.},

These changed circumstances require new and modified competences of future employees. Education has to respond to the changing requirements in working life. To prepare for this, a technological-oriented teaching and learning process as well as gaining practical experience is crucial for students. In this context, Virtual Reality (VR) technologies provide new opportunities for practical experience in higher education, where they can further intensify the students learning experiences to a more immersive and engaging involvement in the learning process. To evaluate the potential of immersive virtual learning environments (VLE) for higher education and to understand more deeply which kind of experiences students gain while learning in immersive virtual environments (VE) an experimental research study is carried out. The paper describes education in light of industry 4.0 first and gives an overall view of immersive learning and the role of VR Technologies. Then the user study to measure user experience (UX) in immersive VLE is presented. Preliminary results are outlined and discussed with a view of further research.},

Our initiative emerged in the second decade of the 21st century amidst a confluence of seismic events in the US that forced the museum field to examine its relationship to social issues. The Empathetic Museum arose as a critique of museums’ indifference and reluctance to engage with issues deeply affecting their communities, especially those of color. We propose a lack of institutional empathy as a subtle yet powerful cause of this indifference. The article traces the development of the Empathetic Museum initiative; the evolution of its philosophy of institutional empathy; the creation of the Maturity Model as a key tool for empathetic practice; and its use and impact in the field. As a work in progress, the Empathetic Museum initiative has evolved and expanded through constant observation of, reflection on, and engagement with the important issues of our time.},

Analyses of these interviews uncovered three themes that were important to these mathematicians: coverage, goals for student learning, and the role of the teacher. Here, by drawing on interview data, classroom data, and first person commentaries, we will present and discuss each teacher's perspective on these three themes.},

  abstract = {Teacher education programs typically teach novices about one part of teaching at a time. We might offer courses on different topics—cultural foundations, learning theory, or classroom management—or we may parse teaching practice itself into a set of discrete techniques, such as core teaching practices, that can be taught individually. Missing from our courses is attention to the ultimate purpose of these discrete parts—how specific concepts can help teachers achieve their goals, or how specific procedures can help them achieve their goals. Because we are now shifting from a focus on bodies of knowledge to a focus on depictions of practice, this article examines our efforts to parse teaching practice into lists of discrete procedures. It argues that we need to pay less attention to the visible behaviors of teaching and more attention to the purposes that are served by those behaviors. As a way to begin a conversation about parsing teachers’ purposes, I offer a proposal for conceptualizing teaching as a practice that entails five persistent problems, each of which presents a difficult challenge to teachers, and all of which compete for teachers’ attention. Viewed in this way, the role of teacher education is not to offer solutions to these problems, but instead to help novices learn to analyze these problems and to evaluate alternative courses of action for how well they address these problems.},

In support of a more systematic approach, we describe the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework. KLI promotes the emergence of instructional principles of high potential for generality, while explicitly identifying constraints of and opportunities for detailed analysis of the knowledge students may acquire in courses. Drawing on research across domains of science, math, and language learning, we illustrate the analyses of knowledge, learning, and instructional events that the KLI framework affords. We present a set of three coordinated taxonomies of knowledge, learning, and instruction. For example, we identify three broad classes of learning events (LEs): (a) memory and fluency processes, (b) induction and refinement processes, and (c) understanding and sense-making processes, and we show how these can lead to different knowledge changes and constraints on optimal instructional choices.},

Insight is gained upon disaggregating results by course type (IBL vs. non-IBL), by gender, and by prior mathematics achievement level. In particular, the impact of IBL on previously low-achieving students’ grades is sizable and persistent. The authors offer some methodological advice to guide future such studies.},

This contribution intends to point out the possibilities of GeoGebra software as an effective tool for teaching mathematics for children between 9 and 11 years of age. We created and circulated a questionnaire to determine the use of technology by primary education teachers in Slovakia and Hungary, and their opinions and experience concerning GeoGebra software.

  abstract = {This paper describes two myths that circulate widely about the potential of students with Learning Disabilities to learn mathematics: (1) that students with Learning Disabilities cannot benefit from inquiry-based instruction in mathematics, and only from explicit instruction; and (2) that students with Learning Disabilities cannot construct their own mathematical strategies and do not benefit from engaging with multiple strategies. In this paper, I will describe how these myths have developed, and identify research that counters these myths. I argue that these myths are the unintended consequences of deficit constructions of students with Learning Disabilities in educational research. Using neurodiversity to frame disability as diversity rather than deficit, I assert that students with Learning Disabilities can learn mathematics to the highest levels, and that these limiting mythologies hold them back.},

In this research commentary, we describe the intellectual origins and development of two major strands of inquiry in US higher education, offer an explanation for apparent differences in these strands, and argue that they be united under a common vision of Inquiry-Based Mathematics Education (IBME). Central to this common vision are four pillars of IBME: student engagement in meaningful mathematics, student collaboration for sensemaking, instructor inquiry into student thinking, and equitable instructional practice to include all in rigorous mathematical learning and mathematical identitybuilding. We conclude this commentary with a call for a four-pronged agenda for research and practice focused on learning trajectories, transferable skills, equity, and a systems approach.},

  abstract = {Most previous research on human cognition has focused on problem-solving, and has confined its investigations to the laboratory. As a result, it has been difficult to account for complex mental processes and their place in culture and history. In this startling - indeed, disco in forting - study, Jean Lave moves the analysis of one particular form of cognitive activity, - arithmetic problem-solving - out of the laboratory into the domain of everyday life. In so doing, she shows how mathematics in the 'real world', like all thinking, is shaped by the dynamic encounter between the culturally endowed mind and its total context, a subtle interaction that shapes 1) Both tile human subject and the world within which it acts. The study is focused on mundane daily, activities, such as grocery shopping for 'best buys' in the supermarket, dieting, and so on. Innovative in its method, fascinating in its findings, the research is above all significant in its theoretical contributions. Have offers a cogent critique of conventional cognitive theory, turning for an alternative to recent social theory, and weaving a compelling synthesis from elements of culture theory, theories of practice, and Marxist discourse. The result is a new way of understanding human thought processes, a vision of cognition as the dialectic between persons-acting, and the settings in which their activity is constituted. The book will appeal to anthropologists, for its novel theory of the relation of cognition to culture and context; to cognitive scientists and educational theorists; and to the 'plain folks' who form its subject, and who will recognize themselves in it, a rare accomplishment in the modern social sciences.},

The authors maintain that learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral participation (LPP). Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. LPP provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and old-timers and about their activities, identities, artefacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalised to other social groups.},

  abstract = {Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that – very broadly– understands knowing the world as inseparable from agencywithin it. This general idea has attracted a remarkably richand at times contrary range of interpretations, including: that allphilosophical concepts should be tested via scientificexperimentation, that a claim is true if and only if it is useful(relatedly: if a philosophical theory does not contribute directly tosocial progress then it is not worth much), that experience consistsin transacting with rather than representing nature, that articulatelanguage rests on a deep bed of shared human practices that can neverbe fully ‘made explicit’. , Pragmatism originated in the United States around 1870, and nowpresents a growing third alternative to both analytic and‘Continental’ philosophical traditions worldwide. Itsfirst generation was initiated by the so-called ‘classicalpragmatists’ Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), who firstdefined and defended the view, and his close friend and colleagueWilliam James (1842–1910), who further developed and ablypopularized it. During this initial period, pragmatists focusedsignificantly on theorising inquiry, meaning and the nature of truth,although James put these themes to work exploring truth in religion. Asecond (still termed ‘classical’) generation turnedpragmatist philosophy more explicitly towards politics, education andother dimensions of social improvement, under the immense influence ofJohn Dewey (1859–1952) and his friend Jane Addams(1860–1935) – who invented the profession of social workas an expression of pragmatist ideas (and was awarded the Nobel PeacePrize in 1931). Also of considerable importance at this time wasGeorge Herbert Mead (1863–1931), who contributed significantlyto the social sciences, developing pragmatist perspectives upon therelations between the self and the community (Mead 1934). As theresulting progressive Deweyan ‘New Deal’ era passed awayand the US moved into the Cold War, pragmatism’s influence waschallenged, as analytic philosophy blossomed and became the dominantmethodological orientation in most Anglo-American philosophydepartments.  Transitional or ‘third generation’ figuresincluded C.I. Lewis and W.V.O. Quine; although these philosophersdeveloped a number of pragmatist themes, their analytic allegiance maybe seen in their significant focus on theory of knowledge as firstphilosophy (which Dewey deprecated as ‘the epistemologicalindustry’)., Following this dip in popularity, since the 1970s the pragmatisttradition has undergone a significant revival. Richard Rorty(1931–2007) turned consciously to pragmatism to rectify what he saw as mainstream epistemology’s crucial mistake: naively conceiving oflanguage and thought as ‘mirroring’ the world.Rorty’s bold and iconoclastic attacks on this‘representationalism’ birthed a so-calledneopragmatism to which a number of influential recentphilosophers have contributed (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Robert Brandom andHuw Price). Other pragmatists have objected to Rorty’s blithedismissal of truth as a topic better left undiscussed (Rorty 1982),and have sought to rehabilitate classical pragmatist ideals ofobjectivity (e.g. Susan Haack, Christopher Hookway and Cheryl Misak).These philosophers are now sometimes referred to as NewPragmatists. Yet others have worked to place pragmatist ideas in abroader Western philosophical context, for instance tracingPeirce’s significant debt to Kant (Apel 1974, Gava 2014), andconnections between pragmatism and 19th century idealism (Margolis2010, Stern 2009). Meanwhile, classical pragmatism’s progressivesocial ideals lived on in some quarters, with notable contributions tophilosophy of race made by Cornel West, who advanced a propheticpragmatism drawing on both Christian and Marxian thought (e.g.West 1989). A number of other liberatory philosophical projects inareas such as feminism (Seigfried 1996), ecology (Alexander 2013),Native American philosophy (Pratt 2002) and Latin American philosophy(Pappas 1998) also currently look to the pragmatist tradition as theirphilosophical home. , Meanwhile, increasingly pragmatism’s intellectual centre ofgravity is moving out of North America, with vibrant research networksappearing in South America, Scandinavia and more recently centralEurope and China. , The core of pragmatism as Peirce originally conceived it was thePragmatic Maxim, a rule for clarifying the meaning of hypotheses bytracing their ‘practical consequences’ – theirimplications for experience in specific situations. For Peirce andJames, a key application of the Maxim was clarifying the conceptof truth. This produced a distinctive epistemological outlook:a fallibilist, anti-Cartesian explication of the norms that governinquiry. Within that broad outlook, though, early pragmatists splitsignificantly over questions of realism broadly conceived– essentially, whether pragmatism should conceive itself as ascientific philosophy holding monism about truth (following Peirce),or a more broad-based alethic pluralism (following James andDewey). This dispute was poignantly emblematized in arguments betweenPeirce and James which led Peirce to rename hisview pragmaticism, presenting this clarified viewpoint to theworld as his new ‘baby’ which was, he hoped, ‘uglyenough to be safe from kidnappers’ (EP2: 355)., The first part of this entry is devoted to the classicalpragmatists’ distinctive methods, and how they give rise to anoriginal a posteriori epistemology. After that we will briefly exploresome of the many other areas of philosophy in which rich pragmatistcontributions have been made.},

Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, sodo numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and planetsare made true or false by the objects with which they are concerned andthese objects’ perfectly objective properties, so are statements aboutnumbers and sets. Mathematical truths are therefore discovered, notinvented., The most important argument for the existence of abstractmathematical objects derives from Gottlob Frege and goes as follows(Frege 1953). The language of mathematics purports to refer to andquantify over abstract mathematical objects. And a great number ofmathematical theorems are true. But a sentence cannot be true unlessits sub-expressions succeed in doing what they purport to do. So thereexist abstract mathematical objects that these expressions refer to andquantify over., Frege’s argument notwithstanding, philosophers have developed avariety of objections to mathematical platonism. Thus, abstract mathematical objects are claimed to be epistemologically inaccessible and metaphysically problematic. Mathematical platonism has been amongthe most hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mathematics over thepast few decades.},

This is especially unfortunate as such environments hold great potential for them for uses such as social interaction, online education and especially for use with familiarizing the visually impaired user with a real environment virtually from the comfort and safety of his own home before visiting it in the real world. We have implemented a simple algorithm to improve this situation using single-point depth information, enabling the blind to use a virtual cane, modeled on the “EyeCane” electronic travel aid, within any virtual environment with minimal preprocessing. Use of the Virtual-EyeCane, enables this experience to potentially be later used in real world environments with identical stimuli to those from the virtual environment. We show the fast-learned practical use of this algorithm for navigation in simple environments.},

  abstract = {This article focuses mainly on two key mathematical processes (representation, and reasoning and proof). Firstly, we observed how teachers learn these processes and subsequently identify what and how to assess learners on the same processes. Secondly, we reviewed one teacher’s attempt to facilitate the learning of the processes in his classroom. Two interrelated questions were pursued: ‘what are the teachers’ challenges in learning mathematical processes?’ and ‘in what ways are teachers’ approaches to learning mathematical processes influencing how they assess their learners on the same processes?’ A case study was undertaken involving 10 high school mathematics teachers who enrolled for an assessment module towards a Bachelor in Education Honours degree in mathematics education. We present an interpretive analysis of two sets of data. The first set consisted of the teachers’ written responses to a pattern searching activity. The second set consisted of a mathematical discourse on matchstick patterns in a Grade 9 class. The overall finding was that teachers rush through forms of representation and focus more on manipulation of numerical representations with a view to deriving symbolic representation. Subsequently, this unidirectional approach limits the scope of assessment of mathematical processes. Interventions with regard to the enhancement of these complex processes should involve teachers’ actual engagements in and reflections on similar learning.},

  abstract = {Mobility provides the fabric of everyday life but is rarely considered part of learning and is almost never used as relevant, experiential content in teaching. This special issue integrates ideas and efforts across different fields into a more unified framework to study and design for what we call Learning on the Move. Approaches used in these studies reflect various ontological and epistemological standpoints, especially with regard to the role of moving bodies, place, and lands/waters in learning, teaching, and development. The heterogeneity of approaches in this special issue potentially helps us to see the complexity of human, more-than-human, and technological relations across time. The specificity of each project necessarily foregrounds certain aspects of activity and history, while backgrounding others. Rather than casting this as problematic, we see this heterogeneity as an opportunity to generate dialogue across research programs that are guided by frameworks of power, historicity, relationality, respect, reciprocity, and accountability. We also take this as an opportunity to raise questions about historical, present-day, and future relationships to lands/waters, place, socio-ecological systems, and socio-technical arrangements. At a practical level, this means having conversations about the differences and similarities between ontological and epistemological conceptions of time, space, place, and lands/waters when studying or designing for Learning on the Move. We anticipate and acknowledge that at times our conceptions of Learning on the Move may align and at other times may be incommensurable.},

  abstract = {The underrepresentation of women (and men of color) in science has motivated many science educators to develop innovate classroom pedagogies aimed at making science courses and curricula more attractive and inviting to all students. One dominant approach to reforming science education is to transform how students learn by implementing collaborative approaches to learning in the classroom. Feminist pedagogy is an alternative approach to science education reform that is concerned with transforming both how students of science learn and the science curriculum that students are expected to learn. This article first compares and contrasts collaborative learning and feminist pedagogy. It then addresses the implications and consequences of each for science education. The theoretical and epistemological foundations of each approach demonstrates that choosing a classroom pedagogy is not an apolitical act. Collaborative approaches to science education serve to reproduce the dominant discourse of existing science systems. In contrast, feminist pedagogy resists the dominant discourse and invites all students to learn science, but more important, it invites them also to critically analyze existing scientific systems and the relationship of those systems to power, oppression, and domination.

  abstract = {Awe is described as an a “epistemic emotion” because it is hypothesised to make gaps in one’s knowledge salient. However, no empirical evidence for this yet exists. Awe is also hypothesised to be an antecedent to interest in science because science is one way to fill those knowledge gaps. Results from four pre-registered studies (N = 1518) indicate that manipulating awe through online (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c) and virtual reality (Study 2) videos, led to greater awareness of knowledge gaps. Awareness of knowledge gaps was consistently associated with greater science interest and to choosing tickets to a science museum over tickets to an art museum (Study 1b). These effects were not consistently observed on, nor moderated by, other measures related to cognition, religion, and spirituality. However, exploratory analyses showed that science interest was better predicted by positive emotions than by awe. Still, these results provide the first empirical evidence of awe as an “epistemic emotion” by demonstrating its effects on awareness of knowledge gaps. These findings are also extended to the effects of awe on science interest as one possible outcome of awareness of knowledge gaps.},

  abstract = {Social robots hold great promise as companions and peer-learners for children, yet little is known about how they can be best designed for this population, what interaction scenarios can benefit from their use, and how they might fit into learning activities and environments. We aim to close this gap by designing a learning-companion robot to augment guided reading activity and examine the robot’s impact on an in-home reading experience. In this paper, we compare the experiences of early adolescent children aged 10 to 12 (N = 24) who either completed guided reading activities with a learning-companion robot or as a paper-based activity in a two-week long, in-home field study. We found similar reading frequency and duration in both conditions and that both guided reading activities were described as positive experiences that help build reading skill and sustain engagement. Children who read with the learning-companion robot further reported that the activities supported reading comprehension and motivated them to read and indicated a deepening social connection (i.e., companionship or affiliation) with the robot. We conclude that rather than the activity falling off after a novelty effect, our simple prototype social robot is capable of preserving the benefits of an existing in-home learning activity while transforming the reading experience into a valuable, social one. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how we might capitalize on the capacity of social robots to serve as a transformative learning tool as robots become more widely available to the public.},

  abstract = {The Moore method is a deductive manner of instruction used in advanced mathematics courses. It is named after Robert Lee Moore, a famous topologist who first used a stronger version of the method at the University of Pennsylvania when he began teaching there in 1911. The way the course is conducted varies from instructor to instructor, but the content of the course is usually presented in whole or in part by the students themselves. Instead of using a textbook, the students are given a list of definitions and theorems which they are to prove and present in class, leading them through the subject material. The Moore method typically limits the amount of material that a class is able to cover, but its advocates claim that it induces a depth of understanding that listening to lectures cannot give.},

  abstract = {Longstanding inequities in science education across the lines of race and class remain the most intractable problem in the field. Justice-centered science pedagogy is introduced as a theoretical framework built on the traditions of critical pedagogy and culturally relevant pedagogy to address these inequities as components of larger oppressive systems. This study examines how a justicecentered advanced chemistry class in an urban neighborhood high school supported students to succeed academically while taking up urgent issues of social and environmental justice identified by their communities. The findings include evidence that curriculum organized around an issue of environmental racism supported academic achievement that exceeded the expectations of a typical high school chemistry course. The findings also document how the curriculum provided opportunities for students to move beyond academic achievement to position themselves as transformative intellectuals. As transformative intellectuals, students demonstrated complex thinking about science and social justice issues, cultivated their commitment to their communities and cultures of origin, and developed credibility as local youth knowledgeable in science. These findings have implications for teachers, teacher educators, and educational researchers who wish to engage with science education as a catalyst for social transformation.},

  abstract = {With the current trend away from affirmative action programs, it is increasingly important that universities retain the African American and Latino students that they admit. In 1988 the University of Texas at Austin (UT) established the Emerging Scholars Program (ESP) to challenge high-achieving students to excel in calculus and pursue mathematics, science, or engineering (MSE) majors. The university makes a special effort to recruit African Americans, Latinos, and women, but the ESP is open to any student, regardless of race or ethnicity, who is committed to excel in calculus. We analyze the influence of calculus performance on choosing a mathematics, science, or engineering major by focusing on variations by race, ethnicity, and gender and on the role of students' participation in the ESP. Findings suggest that ESP students earn higher calculus grades than non-ESP students and are more likely to enroll in the second semester of calculus. Also, earning higher calculus grades increases the likelihood that students will choose a major in mathematics, science, or engineering. These findings suggest that to increase the number of students choosing one of these majors, administrators must seek ways to increase students' participation in calculus each semester. In addition, African Americans, Latinos, and women excel in calculus if they receive appropriate academic challenges and support.},

This article describes the theory and practice of restorative justice with the aim of defining this distinctive paradigm, in comparison to other forms of discipline, as one that uniquely emphasizes social engagement over social control. In so doing, a responsive regulatory framework supports pedagogy, praxis, and discipline such that relational school cultures are nurtured; wherein, behavior is understood in social context, individuals are recognized as being part of a social web of relations, and building, maintaining, and repairing relationships become priorities. This focus on developing rich and embedded relational ecologies finds its strength through nurturing motivational bonds of belonging that support individual development and social responsibility. This is distinct from formal institutional responses that rely on systems of institutional sanctions to leverage compliance.},

This study integrates three theories that support the practice of restorative justice in responding to school bullying: Scheff's theory of unacknowledged shame, Braithwaite's reintegrative shaming theory; and Tyler's procedural justice theory. Specifically, the aim is to test the constructs of shame management (shame acknowledgment and shame displacement) and group value (pride, respect, and emotional group value) in explaining differences across four bullying status groups: nonbully/nonvictim, victim, bully, bully/victim. The results reveal different, but predictable, patterns of social and emotional disconnection from school across these groups. The importance of being emotionally intelligent when addressing bullying behaviors is discussed.},

GEMC proposes that participants’ actions serve as inputs capable of driving the cognition-action system toward associated cognitive states. This occurs through a process of transduction that promotes valuable mathematical insights by eliciting dynamic depictive gestures that enact spatio-temporal properties of mathematical entities. Our focus here is on pre-college geometry proof production. GEMC suggests that action alone can foster insight but is insufficient for valid proof production if action is not coordinated with language systems for propositionalizing general properties of objects and space. GEMC guides the design of a video game-based learning environment intended to promote students’ mathematical insights and informal proofs by eliciting dynamic gestures through in-game directed actions.},

  abstract = {There are many reasons to be curious about the way people learn, and the past several decades have seen an explosion of research that has important implications for individual learning, schooling, workforce training, and policy. In 2000, How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition was published and its influence has been wide and deep. The report summarized insights on the nature of learning in school-aged children; described principles for the design of effective learning environments; and provided examples of how that could be implemented in the classroom. Since then, researchers have continued to investigate the nature of learning and have generated new findings related to the neurological processes involved in learning, individual and cultural variability related to learning, and educational technologies. In addition to expanding scientific understanding of the mechanisms of learning and how the brain adapts throughout the lifespan, there have been important discoveries about influences on learning, particularly sociocultural factors and the structure of learning environments. How People Learn II: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures provides a much-needed update incorporating insights gained from this research over the past decade. The book expands on the foundation laid out in the 2000 report and takes an in-depth look at the constellation of influences that affect individual learning. How People Learn II will become an indispensable resource to understand learning throughout the lifespan for educators of students and adults.},

  abstract = {When people talk, they gesture, and those gestures often reveal information that cannot be found in speech. Learners are no exception. A learner's gestures can index moments of conceptual instability, and teachers can make use of those gestures to gain access into a student's thinking. Learners can also discover novel ideas from the gestures they produce during a lesson, or from the gestures they see their teachers produce. Gesture thus has the power not only to reflect a learner's understanding of a problem, but also to change that understanding. This review explores how gesture supports learning across development, and ends by offering suggestions for ways in which gesture can be recruited in educational settings.},

By classroom discourse we mean here the talk that is conducted as part of instruction, and that is intended to function as a vehicle of instruction. Our overarching purpose in this chapter is to explicate challenges that teachers must manage in putting into practice certain forms of classroom discourse. We focus on these challenges to (a) shed light on what it takes to successfully implement classroom discussion, and (b) inform researchers who need to understand these dimensions to design and interpret research on classroom instruction. We selectively review some strands of the literature on classroom discourse to describe a set of dimensions that we think are important for teacher practice and development, and for researchers who seek to better understand certain forms of classroom discourse.},

This paper describes disability-related research for policy makers which is carried out at the Social Policy Research Unit (SPRU), University of York. A distinction between the ways in which research is formed and the ways in which it is informed is made . The informing of research influences how it is carried out ; the research questions themselves, the choice of design and methods, the form of analysis, and the pattern of dissemination. The seminar series has helped SPRU reappraise its disability-related research . Disabled people must be able to influence the framing and elaboration of research questions more directly; there must be an increased commitment to employing and to training disabled researchers ; dissemination must be wider; `crucial gateways' to policy makers and practitioners have to be identified ; and the debate on informal care must be moved further on .},

  abstract = {Educational environment influences students’ learning attitudes, and the classroom conveys the educational philosophy. The traditional college classroom design is based on the educational space that first appeared in medieval universities. Since then classrooms have not changed except in their size. In an attempt to develop a different perspective of educational environment, a new design of classroom, the active learning classroom (ALC), was established at SoongSil University in Korea. Two questionnaire surveys were conducted for diagnosing the educational effects of students’ learning in the ALC and comparing the results with those obtained regarding the traditional classroom. The result proved the existence of a ‘golden zone’ and a ‘shadow zone’ in the traditional classroom, which discriminate students’ learning experiences depending on seating positions. On the contrary, the ALC did not produce such positional discrimination. Students perceived the ALC environment as more inspirational, especially in regards to active class participation. Students with more emphasis on academic achievement showed greater tendency to share information and to create new ideas in the ALC. However, in the traditional classroom setting, only students with high GPAs were more motivated to learn while the gap in learning attitudes was offset in the ALC setting. In-depth discussions about research findings were undertaken and four suggestions were provided in support of school administrators and relevant institutional personnel, faculty members, and researchers for future utilization of the ALC.},

Four fifth grade students participated in a usability study. Results were mixed with researchers observing successful use of Google Glass by all participants along with enthusiastic engagement, but also recording a lengthy learning curve and hardware issues that distracted from the learning process. Wearable augmented reality is still in its infancy, but potential was demonstrated.},

The overt learning experience is based in the design questions defined and the subtle experience was derived by examining the idea of sense of place as it relates to the virtual environment. By considering these two streams of learning, designers can avoid pitfalls and build on these design elements of a virtual learning environment.},

Section IV considers the implications for design of classroom and large-scale assessment.

Largely people with disabilities feel empowered by the ADA. However, a strong amount of cynicism is also found at the grass roots level regarding it. A revealing example of the empowerment felt by people with disabilities is the con¯ ict in New York City over a proposal for non-accessible public toilets. Other reactions and developments are discussed including the possibility of the repeal or weakening of the ADA. A fundamental change occurred in the US with the passage of the ADA and the disability community will not allow that change to be undone.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we examine a significant shift in research in the learning sciences, mathematics education, and science education that increasingly attends to the co-construction of power and learning. We review articles in these fields that embody a new sense of theoretical and methodological possibilities and dilemmas, brewing at the intersections of critical social theory and the methodological approaches of interaction analysis and microgenetic analysis. We organize our review into three thematic categories: (1) the dynamic construction of identity and ideology, (2) attending to the organization of a learning environment, and (3) leveraging and repurposing tools. Reading across these thematic areas, we identify and outline a burgeoning subfield that we term critical interaction and microgenetic analysis. By bringing this collection of articles together, this chapter provides collective epistemic and empirical weight to claims of power and learning as co-constituted and co-constructed through interactional, microgenetic, and structural dynamics. In our conclusions, we suggest six analytical commitments that are important to hold when engaging in critical interaction and microgenetic analysis.},

Measures included a scale of awe-related emotions and constructed-response questions about what they learned during their visit. Results show a profile of awe-related emotions that is consistent across institutions, which suggests awe may have roots outside of the specific contextual experiences (i.e. anticipation of the visit). Guest memories of educational and emotional experiences at the institutions were weakly related to some aspects of awe, but not all. This connection was strongest with memories of emotional connections and being surprised. Prior knowledge was also positively related to awe.},

To illuminate those specific ways, we focus on three dimensions of qualitative research that emerged as particularly important to our interdependent methodology: time, gaze, and emotion.},

There have been attempts to applythe results also in other areas of philosophy such as the philosophyof mind, but these attempted applications are more controversial.

  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is an educational medium increasingly accessible to young users such as elementary school and high school students. Although previous research has shown that AR systems have the potential to improve student learning, the educational community remains unclear regarding the educational usefulness of AR and regarding contexts in which this technology is more effective than other educational mediums. This paper addresses these topics by analyzing 26 publications that have previously compared student learning in AR versus non-AR applications. It identifies a list of positive and negative impacts of AR experiences on student learning and highlights factors that are potentially underlying these effects. This set of factors is argued to cause differences in educational effectiveness between AR and other media. Furthermore, based on the analysis, the paper presents a heuristic questionnaire generated for judging the educational potential of AR experiences.},

In this project, we have designed a Hololensbased system in which collaborators are exposed to an unstructured learning activity in which they learned about the invisible physics involved in audio speakers. They learned topics ranging from spatial knowledge, such as shape of magnetic fields, to abstract conceptual knowledge, such as relationships between electricity and magnetism. We compared participants’ learning, attitudes and collaboration with a tangible interface through multiple experimental conditions containing varying layers of AR information. We found that educational AR representations were beneficial for learning specific knowledge and increasing participants’ self-efficacy (i.e., their ability to learn concepts in physics). However, we also found that participants in conditions that did not contain AR educational content, learned some concepts better than other groups and became more curious about physics. We discuss learning and collaboration differences, as well as benefits and detriments of implementing augmented reality for unstructured learning activities.},

We offer the model as a tool for researchers and change agents who wish to study and enact systemic change within STEM departments. We provide the four frames in contrast to overly simplistic models of change that have been shown to be unlikely to result in sustainable improvements. As we outline the four frames, we discuss both how the frames provide insight into potential products for change and how they influence the process of change. We provide an extended example of how the four frames can be used to analyze an existing change effort and implications of this approach for future work. Conclusions: This paper adapts a model for promoting and understanding change efforts in STEM departments. This is a model that can be used by nearly any researcher or administrator to help increase the impact of their work.},

This case study has been carried out with a view to replying the question of how we can make the subject of integers, which students in the 6th grades find too difficult to learn, easier and more permanent. The subject of Integers is one of the most difficult subjects that students have difficulty in grasping because they have only learnt natural numbers in Math. In general, when students come across a new number system, they have difficulty in learning it. Also, as they haven’t conceptualized the subject, they do not like the subject and cannot correlate the mathematical links. However, as teachers and mathematics educators, our duty is to make our students enjoy the subject of integers and ensure its retention. For this purpose, so as to eliminate the problems faced during the learning process, we have tried to conceptualize the subject by employing new software, Geogebra, by which we aim to provide a permanent learning for our students.},

  abstract = {Mathematics and science education researchers focused on teacher education emphasize attention and responsiveness to student thinking as central to effective classroom practice. Being responsive to student thinking involves attending to the substance of students’ ideas—the meaning students are making—and pursuing that thinking, adjusting the flow of instruction as needed. Yet, attention and responsiveness to student thinking is irregular and generally rare among novice teachers. In this theoretical paper, we argue that the irregularity of attention and responsiveness to student thinking, including variability within individual teachers’ practice, can be explained by a framework grounded in teachers’ localized framings of their classroom activity—their sense of “what is it that’s going on here.” Using analyses of classroom episodes across contexts and timescales to illustrate our claims, we demonstrate how a framing-anchored framework can coordinate and improve upon three common explanations for the irregularity of novice teachers’ attention and responsiveness to student thinking: underdeveloped skills and/or knowledge for attending and responding, “transmissionist” beliefs about learning, and institutional constraints (and teachers’ perceptions thereof). Building on this argument, we suggest that teacher educators can work with novice teachers’ framings of their classroom activities as a generative anchor for supporting attention and responsiveness to student thinking in classroom settings.},

  abstract = {This guide to universal design in the classroom is divided into two sections. The first addresses the concept of universal design for learning (UDL); the second addresses the practical application of UDL in the classroom. Each chapter opens with a summary of key ideas and a graphic organizer that illustrates how the concepts fit together. The eight chapters address the following topics: (1) "Education in the Digital Age;" (2) "What Brain Research Tells Us about Learner Differences;" (3) "Why We Need Flexible Instructional Media;" (4) "What Is Universal Design for Learning?;" (5) "Using UDL To Set Clear Goals;" (6) "Using UDL To Support Every Student's Learning;" (7) "Using UDL To Accurately Assess Student Progress;" and (8) "Making Universal Design for Learning a Reality". An  appendix offers four classroom templates to help teachers apply the UDL framework. The templates address: a class learning profile, curriculum barriers, UDL solutions, and creating systematic change. Each template includes an introduction and three parts: an example of how the template might be used, collected sample items to use in the blank template, and a framework for applying UDL.

Learners are expected to articulate, develop, and defend their ideas and respond to the ideas of others. Decades of prior research have carefully documented features, processes, and potential benefits and shortcomings of an emphasis on talk in science learning. Yet, the task of documenting change in learners’ talk over time remains a major methodological challenge. To address this challenge, we examine one Korean immigrant girl’s (Selena) oral participation during an informal science learning program called Science Club. Quantitative analysis showed that, over time, Selena spoke more often and for longer. However, fine‐grained qualitative analysis of features of her talk (e.g., use of a variety of bids and hedges) demonstrated Selena’s persistent desire to share ideas, even though the intellectual merits of those ideas went largely unacknowledged. Methodologically, Selena’s case illustrates the importance of considering multiple features of learner talk, understood in the social context, when making claims about changes in oral participation over time. Pedagogically, Selena’s case highlights the importance of teachers’ attention to how learners’ ideas are taken up, in addition to how frequently they are speaking in class.},

  abstract = {Many research indicated that ICT has been proven useful as a tool in supporting and transforming teaching and learning. In mathematics classroom, ICT can help students and teachers to perform calculation, analyse data, explore mathematical concepts thus increasing the understanding in mathematics. This quasi-experimental study with non-equivalent control group post-test only design was conducted to examine the effects of using a free-software called GeoGebra in the learning of Coordinate Geometry among students classified as high visual-spatial ability students (HV) and low visual-spatial ability students (LV). The Spatial Visualization Ability Test Instrument (SVATI) had been used to categorize the students in different spatial ability level. A total of 53 secondary school students in Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur participated in the study. They were assigned into two different groups. One group was taught Coordinate Geometry using GeoGebra while the other underwent learning the traditional way. Students’ mathematics achievement was measured using post test at the end of the intervention. The test format was based on Additional Mathematics KBSM syllabus. Independent samples t-test results showed that there was a significant difference in mean mathematical achievement between the GeoGebra group (M=65.23, SD=19.202) and the traditional teaching strategy group (M=54.7, SD=15.660); [t (51) = 2.259, p= .028 {$<$} .05]. This study also found that the HV students performed better than the LV students in both group. Findings showed that there were no significant different among HV students between GeoGebra group and traditional group. Meanwhile the LV students in GeoGebra group (M=64.07, SD=21.569) significantly outperformed the LV students in traditional group (M=48.79, SD=15.106); [t (51) = 2.222, p= .036 {$<$} .05]. These findings showed that the use of GeoGebra enhanced the students’ performance in learning Coordinate Geometry.},

  abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) is recognized as one of the most important developments in educational technology for both higher and K-12 education as emphasized in Horizon report (Johnson et al., 2016, 2015). Furthermore, AR is expected to achieve widespread adoption that will take two to three years in higher education and four to five years in K-12 education (Johnson et al., 2016, 2012). If this is the current state of the art for the use of AR in education, it is important to investigate how educators and researchers integrate AR into teaching-learning processes. Looking from such a glimpse, the purpose of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant research regarding the emergence of augmented reality, the links to pedagogy and educational outcomes, specifically in the context of formal education. The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework Arksey and O’Malley (2005). First, research questions are identified. Second, the last five years in ERIC database is explored by using the search term ‘augmented reality.’ Third, studies are investigated through inclusion and exclusion criteria, and PRISMA (2009) model is utilized for article selection. Fourth, selected articles are charted with respect to numerous dimensions and summaries. Finally, findings are reported in the light of research questions. The findings of the scoping review illustrated a set of studies that provide evidence of improved academic performance, increase in students’ engagement, motivation, and satisfaction through the educational environments that are enriched with AR applications. The findings of the scoping review are discussed with respect to multiple dimensions that are explored under research questions.},

  abstract = {Students struggle with proving, a fundamental activity in upper-level undergraduate mathematics courses. Learning how to prove is a difficult transition for students, as they shift from largely computation-based to argument-based work. In response, mathematics departments have instituted courses, introduction or transition to proof, designed to help students learn how to prove. Existing research has extensively examined students' errors, struggles, and some of their strategies at a given point in time, but we know little about students' development over a longer period of time. There is a need for longitudinal work in this area, to follow students through the transition to proof. In addition, little is known about the affective side of proving (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, emotions). Affect plays a central role in mathematics learning, influencing students' cognitive processes while problem solving and their motivation to value and want to do mathematics. Understanding affective issues are important, as students consider their future participation in mathematical work and communities. Positive experiences at transitional junctions, such as learning how to prove, are crucial for retention of students through the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) pipeline. The purpose of this work was to explore the cognitive and affective factors involved in undergraduates' efforts to learn how to prove: how their proving developed during a transition to proof course and what kinds of "satisfying moments," i.e. positive emotional reactions, they experienced. Four semi-structured interviews across a semester were conducted with eleven undergraduate students enrolled in a transition to proof course. The resulting data was analyzed using qualitative methods. Findings indicate that students showed growth in fluency, strategy use, and monitoring and judgement over time. Four developments were frequently observed across the sample: (1) increased sophistication in students' rationales for choice of proof techniques, (2) awareness about how a solution attempt was going and managing that for their subsequent strategies, (3) intentional exploring and monitoring when unsure about what direction to pursue, and (4) checking examples in conjunction with other strategies as a way to become unstuck. The variety of developments--and the different ways in which they emerged--is significant, because it confirms that multiple developments occur in different ways, strongly suggesting that there is no one path that students take through the transition to proof. Students' satisfying moments were largely about accomplishments both with and without struggle, understanding, external validation, as well as interacting with others. A theory for how satisfying moments are elicited was proposed. Expectations and a sense of mastery played large roles in mediating satisfying moments, but students' desire for understanding and sense-making was also prominent. This work provides guidance for curriculum design of transition to proof courses, in considering how to support students' development in proving. In addition, examination of just what makes a satisfying moment satisfying is helpful in thinking about how to construct mathematical tasks with opportunities for positive experiences with math.

Especially for service robots, gestures can be a valuable addition to the means of communication to, for example, draw the robot's attention to someone or something. Extracting a gesture from video data and classifying it is a challenging task and a variety of approaches have been proposed throughout the years. This paper presents a method for gesture recognition in RGB videos using OpenPose to extract the pose of a person and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in conjunction with One-Nearest-Neighbor (1NN) for time-series classification. The main features of this approach are the independence of any specific hardware and high flexibility, because new gestures can be added to the classifier by adding only a few examples of it. We utilize the robustness of the Deep Learning-based OpenPose framework while avoiding the data-intensive task of training a neural network ourselves. We demonstrate the classification performance of our method using a public dataset.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to better understand how new chemistry graduate students develop a teaching identity as GTAs. Specifically, this study considered two cases of first year chemistry graduate students engaging in teaching for the first time. Data sources included interviews, journals, classroom observations, and artifact ion collection. Classroom observations were used to describe the practices of the GTAs and when combined with the journals and interviews were used to develop an understanding of their identity development. The findings from the two cases produced descriptions of teaching practice, learning environment factors that mediated the GTA teaching practices, and two different models of teaching identity for the new GTAs. Both GTAs began teaching with models of teaching identity drawn from their own experiences as students. In Case 1, the GTA’s model of teaching identity was labeled as helper. In Case 2, the GTA’s model of teaching identity was labeled as leader. I found that the discourse between the students and GTAs did not directly have evidence of teaching identity. In a chemistry classroom, the GTA-student talk is centered on atoms, molecules, and reactions. I found evidence for understanding metapragmatic models of teaching identity in teaching practices and their interaction with learning environment factors. Five learning environment factors were identified in this study: Content, Worksheet structure, Mode of Instruction, Social interactions, and GTA observations. The description of the learning environment factors has methodological implications for expanding the usefulness of the Communities of Practice and Social Identification frameworks. In addition, learning environment factors and GTA teaching identity should be considered when developing training and professional development for graduate students.},

  abstract = {Students are expected to learn mathematics such that when they encounter challenging problems they will persist. Creating opportunities for students to persist in problem solving is therefore argued as essential to effective teaching and to children developing positive dispositions in mathematical learning. This analysis takes a novel approach to perseverance by conceptualizing it as collective enterprise among learners in lieu of its more conventional treatment as an individual capacity. Drawing on video of elementary school children in two US classrooms (n = 52), this paper offers: (1) empirical examples that define perseverance as collective enterprise; (2) indicators of perseverance for teachers (and researchers) to support (and study) its emergence; and (3) evidence of how the task, peer dynamics, and student-teacher interactions afford or constrain its occurrence. The significance of perseverance as collective enterprise and as an object of design in developing effective learning communities, is discussed.},

  abstract = {To support equitable and ambitious teaching practices, classroom assessment design must be grounded in a research-based theory of learning. Compared to other theories, sociocultural theory offers a more powerful, integrative account of how motivational aspects of learning—such as self-regulation, self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and identity—are completely entwined with cognitive development. Instead of centering assessment within systems that support use of interim and end-of-year standardized tests, we argue for a vision of formative assessment based on discipline-specific tasks and questions that can provide qualitative insights about student experience and thinking, including their identification with disciplinary practices. At the same time, to be consistent with a productive formative assessment culture, grading policies should avoid using points and grades “to motivate” students but should create opportunities for students to use feedback to improve their work. We argue for districts as the locus for the design of such coherent curriculum, instruction, and assessment activity systems because districts have responsibility for curriculum, teacher professional development, and equity; and districts allocate resources for textbooks and assessment.},

Children were taught either one or two problem-solving strategies in speech accompanied by no gesture, gesture conveying the same strategy, or gesture conveying a different strategy. The children were likely to profit from instruction with gesture, but only when it conveyed a different strategy than speech did. Moreover, two strategies were effective in promoting learning only when the second strategy was taught in gesture, not speech. Gesture thus has an active hand in learning.},

This study aims at examining (a) how teacher beliefs influenced practices; and (b) how the influence on practices, in turn, impacted student inquiry learning in a CSCL environment. Through a fine-grained comparative analysis of two cases, this study explores how two teachers with different collections of beliefs enacted the same mathematics lesson on division and fractions in a CSCL environment premised on inquiry principles, and what the connections between different enactments and students’ progressive inquiry process and outcomes were. The findings suggest that the two teachers’ adherence to different beliefs led to different practices, which in turn contributed to different student learning processes and outcomes. We interpret these differences that shaped the students’ opportunities for progressive inquiry in the CSCL environment. We conclude that the teacher holding “innovationoriented” beliefs tended to enact the lesson in patterns of inquiry-principle-based practices and technology-enhanced orchestration; these patterns interacted with each other to contribute to student inquiry learning and effective use of technology affordances.},

To frame this review, we distinguish between instructional activities and teaching practice and present six categories of published scholarship that consider collegiate teaching but are not descriptive empirical research on teaching practice. Empirical studies can reveal important differences among teachers’ thinking and actions, promote discussions of practice, and support learning about teaching. To support such research, we developed a preliminary framework of cognitively oriented dimensions of teaching practice based on our review of empirical research on pre-college and college teaching.},

Researchers have taken notice, and educational MMOGs are now beginning to emerge; however, there is a paucity of research on the actual culture/cognition of MMOGameplay, despite its necessity for sound theory and viable design. This paper outlines an ongoing cognitive ethnography of a currently thriving MMOG. Using discourse analytic methods, this project is developing a “thick description” (Geertz, 1973) of naturally-occurring gameplay, paying particular attention to the forms of socially and materially distributed cognition that emerge, the learning mechanisms embedded within community practice, and the ways in which participation shapes and is shaped by the situated (on- and off-screen) identities of its members. After outlining the data collection and analysis methods used, I present an illustrative analysis of selected data and preliminary findings specific to learning within this new virtual space for play.},

We argue that spatial training offers one of the many promising avenues for increasing student success in STEM fields, but research studies that show such training causally improve retention, achievement, and degree attainment remain outstanding.},

Without addressing the issues of effective learning, their use can compound the mistakes of the past and leave the learner with a passive, unengaging experience leading to surface learning. Educators need to recognise that learning is a social process and that providing an effective learning environment which facilitates the active acquisition of subject-specific and general expertise, and addresses the need to adopt a specific subject or professional culture, requires more than electronically delivered course notes and email discussion. Quality of course design, use of appropriate tools and the context in which learning takes place are prime factors affecting success in the era of mass higher education and lifelong learning.},

Disability research has attracted much methodological criticism from disabled people who argue that it has taken place within an oppressive theoretical paradigm and within an oppressive set of social relations. These issues are of heightened significance for non-disabled researchers and bear many similarities to those faced by researchers investigating barriers to the social inclusion of women, Black and 'Third World' peoples. Such challenges have led to the development of an 'emancipatory' research paradigm. Six principles of emancipatory research are identified and the authors own research projects are critically examined within this framework. A number of contradictions are identified and an attempt made to balance the twin requirements of political action and academic rigour.},

Based on a rigorous literature review and analysis of existing quality approaches and quality indicators for MOOCs, the Global MOOC Quality Survey was designed targeting at three core interest groups: MOOC learners, MOOC designers and MOOC facilitators. A total of n=267 took part in the survey. The survey results were complemented with 45 semi-structured interviews with MOOC designers, facilitators and providers. This mixed method research was selected to provide a more coherent picture and analysis of the quality issues of MOOCs by investigating them from diverse and different perspectives. This paper presents first results from the survey and semi-structured interviews, the first QRF draft and the feedback gained from workshops at international conferences.},

Prior research has examined, documented, and cast light on theprocesses underpinning different problems of classroom practice in the area of proof, buthas paid less emphasis on acting upon such problems to generate possible solutions throughresearch-based interventions in mathematics classrooms.

The study was carried out using an embedded design, and the Definite Integral Knowledge Test and an opinion form were used for data collection. Upon analyzing the data, the computer-assisted instruction method using GeoGebra was found to positively contribute to the success of teaching the definite integral topic. Prospective teachers stated that this method should be used in math courses as it creates a fun and interesting environment with dynamic learning elements, provides visualization and opportunities to learn mathematics through practice and exercises, enables thorough understanding and explication of skills, and makes way for conceptual learning instead of memorizing. Furthermore, this study was found to facilitate conceptual learning of the relationship between the lower sum, upper sum and Riemann sum.},

  abstract = {Logicism is a philosophical, foundational, andfoundationalist doctrine that can be advanced with respect toany branch of mathematics. Traditionally, logicism has concerneditself especially with arithmetic and real analysis. It comes in astronger and a weaker version. , The strong version of logicism maintains that allmathematical truths in the chosen branch(es) form a speciesof logical truth. The weak version of logicism, by contrast, maintainsonly that all the theorems do. (By ‘theorems’ wemean results that are provable within the branch ofmathematics in question.) The foundationalism is with respect to thoseparts of mathematics that the logicist reconstructs. Success in thisregard is compatible, however, with a non-foundationalist (e.g.,coherentist) view of the parts of mathematics that cannot be soreconstructed. , Both versions of logicism—strong and weak—maintain that, For the foundationalist who accepts Kant’s distinction betweenanalytic and synthetic truth, the truths of logic are paradigm casesof analytic truths. They are true solely by virtue of the meaningsof the linguistic expressions involved in expressing them; or, asKant might have preferred it, by virtue of internal relations amongthe concepts involved. A successful logicist reduction of any branchof mathematics will therefore show that its truths (strong version) orits theorems (weak version) are analytic. , Another consequence of successful logicist reduction of a given branchof mathematics is that mathematical certainty (within that branch) isof a piece with certainty about logical truth. The same holds fornecessity; and for the a priori character of the knowledgeconcerned. , Logicist doctrines were espoused in two main forms—Fregean andRussellian—until around 1930, at which point logicism went intodecline, largely because of the discovery of Gödelianincompleteness, and the ascendancy of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,which displaced the Russellian theory of types as the most promisingfoundational theory for mathematics. The doctrine ofneo-logicism subsequently revived some of the core ideas oflogicism, with its first hints appearing in the mid-1960s, and itsmore substantive contributions beginning in the 1980s. , The main technical and philosophical innovation of theneo-logicists is their use of abstraction principlesin order to secure the existence of such things as numbers,understood, with Frege, as logical objects. One favored kindof abstraction principle typically effects the reification ofequivalence classes of an equivalence relation.[1] One of Frege’s favorite examples involved the equivalencerelation of parallelism among lines. The relevant abstraction would bethat of the direction of a line. Thus, two linesl1 and l2 have the samedirection just in case they are parallel: , The function denoted by the abstraction operator d(\,) ishere applied to lines, and produces directions (new abstractobjects) as its values. Note that the abstraction operator can takevariables as arguments. , The neo-logicists characterize abstraction operators that producenumbers as their values. Details of notation and method willbe provided in due course. , There has not been any historical trend discernible as anevolution of the doctrine of logicism, with incrementaladjustments to deal with occasional problems as they arose, whilemaintaining a reasonably stable trajectory towards an idealformulation. Rather, the doctrine has been characterized by abruptshifts as far as methods and materials are concerned, even if the goalhas remained relatively constant through such changes.[2] We shall allow the pattern of change to become evident as thedifferent phases of logicism are recounted below.},

  abstract = {K-12 classroom settings are not yet incorporating emerging technologies such as ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, nor even touch surfaces, despite the significant impact that such media have made in many other aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, classroom environments have not generally evolved to support students in the new modes of collaboration, idea sharing, and inquiry that characterize many of our research-based innovations. Responding to this challenge, our research was conducted by a multi-disciplinary design team including educational researchers, a high school physics teacher, and technology designers. We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students’ physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry. One important outcome of this work is a set of design principles for supporting smart classroom research.},

Results from the 24 collected studies showed heterogeneity among effect sizes, both in magnitude and direction. Using a random effects model, a small but marginally significant overall effect (dRE ¼ 0:13; p ¼ :02) suggested that mathematics video games contributed to higher learning gains as compared with traditional instructional methods. In addition, moderator analyses were mixed in terms of statistical significance and explored effect‐size heterogeneity across effects using grade level, instrument type, length of game‐based intervention, country, publication type, and study year characteristics. Overall findings indicate that video games are a slightly effective instructional strategy for teaching mathematics across PreK12th‐grade levels.},

Experiments have aimed to prevent criminal behavior or one of three important delinquency risk factors: socially disruptive behavior, cognitive deficits, and poor parenting. Experiments with juvenile delinquency as an outcome demonstrate that positive results are more likely when interventions are aimed at more than one risk factor, last for a relatively long period of time, and are implemented before adolescence. Experiments featuring early childhood interventions with socially disruptive behavior, cognitive deficits, or parenting as an outcome generally have positive effects. The majority of studies, small-scale confirmation or replication experiments, need to be followed by large-scale field experiments that test the efficacy and cost of implementation in regular service systems.},

Each argues that the long-term goal when dealing with rule breaking is to motivate rule breakers to become more self-regulating in their future conduct. This goal is undermined by punishment-focused models of sanctioning. Sanction-based models, which dominate current thinking about managing criminals, have negative consequences for the individual wrongdoer and for society. It is argued that greater focus needs to be placed on psychological approaches whose goal is to connect with and activate internal values within wrongdoers with the goal of encouraging self-regulatory law-related behavior in the future.},

Empathy has been found to improve classroom teachers’ capacity to (re)act or respond to youth in ways that produce evidence of CRP. However, there are too few instructive models in teacher education that help connect teacher candidates’ knowledge of students and communities to development of efficacious physical habits, tendencies, and trends in observable behavior or teacher dispositions. The application of empathy operationalized through perspective taking is one such model useful to preparing teacher candidates to make professional decisions that produce evidence of CRP. Engaging teacher candidates in perspective taking—adopting the social perspectives of others as an act and process of knowing—invites them to obtain (and reason with) new knowledge of students and the sociocultural context where she or he will teach. Recommendations for modeling and practicing perspective taking in teacher education are discussed.},

It also corresponds to some aspects of thepractice of advanced mathematicians in some periods—for example,the treatment of imaginary numbers for some time afterBombelli’s introduction of them, and perhaps the attitude ofsome contemporary mathematicians towards the higher flights of settheory. Finally, it is often the position to which philosophicallynaïve respondents will gesture towards, when pestered byquestions as to the nature of mathematics. Not surprisingly then, manyphilosophers of mathematics view “game formalism” ashopelessly implausible.

The purpose of the present research was to investigate how the effectiveness of invention activities may be mediated by composition of the small groups in terms of their mathematical skills. In two studies, small groups of undergraduates engaged in an ‘‘inventing standard deviation’’ task. Results suggested that groups may need at least one member with high math ability to take advantage of ‘‘learning by invention’’. Groups consisting of both high and low math ability members generated a broader range of solution attempts during the invention task, and this seemed to be related to better uptake of the standard deviation formula from a later lesson.},

Often vulnerable populations are exposed to research that is driven by dominant epistemologies, research methodologies, and socio-cultural lenses that can exacerbate their vulnerability, negating their socio-cultural reality. In this paper it is contended that researchers should review the way in which research is constructed and developed by creating a culturally safe space for research to occur with those who are vulnerable.

  abstract = {This paper investigates whether prompting students to draw their own visual representations enhances students’ learning from technology-based instructional activities with visual representations. Seventytwo undergraduate students were randomly assigned to receive an educational technology with (1) drawing prompts throughout instruction, (2) drawing prompts before and after instruction, or (3) no drawing prompts. We assessed learning outcomes with respect to instructional effectiveness and efficiency using immediate and delayed posttests. Results on instructional efficiency showed a significant advantage for drawing prompts. Results on instructional effectiveness showed an advantage at the delayed posttest for drawing prompts provided throughout instruction, compared to prompts before and after. Qualitative analyses suggest that adding drawing prompts throughout instruction promotes drawing quality. In sum, our findings expand theory by suggesting that drawing prompts facilitate visual sense making of concepts shown in visual representations. Furthermore, we provide practical recommendations on how best to implement drawing prompts with technology-based instructional activities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Learning and problem solving in the natural sciences and history is affected by epistemic cognition. Likewise, it has recently been proposed that the same is true for interpreting literature, although there is little empirical research on how individual differences in epistemic cognition for literary reading impact literary interpretation (Lee, Goldman, Levine, \& Magliano, 2016). The development of a valid and reliable assessment of epistemic cognition for literature is an important step in examining this question. The present study takes a first study toward such a scale in that it reports the development of a scale that for assessing adolescents' epistemic cognitions for literary reading, the Literature Epistemic Cognition Scale (LECS). Results address the content validity, factorial validity, criterion validity, and reliability of the three constructs assessed on the LECS: relevance of literature to understand people and the human experience; openness of literary works to multiple meanings and interpretations; functionality of multiple readings of literary works for interpretation. The study involved a large sample of middle school students in the U.S. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the three-factor structure of the LECS. Criterion validity was established via correlational analyses between the subscale of the LECS and measures of the speed of acquiring knowledge, liking of reading, and frequency of reading as assessed through additional surveys. The implications of the results and directions for potential future research are discussed.},

A further distinction is made between material and social relations of disability research production . It is argued that, although there are significant constraints imposed by the material relations of research production, genuine progress can still be made in changing the social relations of disability research . Based on the experience of doing research commissioned by organisations of disabled people and other work carried out within a framework of `user's perspectives' on services and policy, the discussion focuses on the lessons we have learnt-and those we still need to learn-about how to change the relations of research production. Consultation between researchers and disabled people, subjecting research to critical scrutiny, and making researchers accountable to disabled people are suggested as key issues in the development of participatory research .},

The participants in this study were 33 pre-service mathematics teachers. An open-ended questionnaire, knowledge test, tasks, and participants’ dynamic constructions were used as data collection tools. The analysis of participants’ products was based on descriptive analysis and Toulmin’s model. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the participants constructed the relationship between the concepts of differential and derivative as well as the concepts of tangent and slope by using them within the geometric framework. Due to the integration of GeoGebra and the ACODESA method, the participants explored the relationships among true change, estimated change, and error by using the geometric interpretation of the concept of differential. It was found that with this method, they deduced that Δx and dx were two different symbols for the same variable.},

  abstract = {A quasi-experiment was conducted to determine the effects of using the software GeoGebra as teaching aid on the achievement of Form Two students. The experimental study was conducted on 80 Form Two students, 40 of whom comprised the treatment group and 40 formed the control group. Data were analysed using the software ANATES 4 and SPSS 24.0. Significant differences were found in student achievements in relation to the topics of functions and limit functions according to their group type. Research outcomes also showed that teachers and students approved the use of GeoGebra in the teaching and learning of mathematics. GeoGebra can illustrate mathematical concepts and procedures well through visuals and graphs, which considerably aid students in mastering and understanding concepts and procedures pertaining to functions and limit functions. This software is user-friendly and can relieve the teachers’ burden in explaining functions. Even though the use of GeoGebra is time consuming, teaching by using the software can render the students’ learning process increasingly active. Moreover, learning mathematics with the help of GeoGebra allows for an active interaction between teachers and students. This study provides suggestions as interventions for increasing student achievement.},
