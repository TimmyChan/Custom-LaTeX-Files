We begin by discussing the limitations of reductive conceptions of disability. In so doing, we consider how far Bourdieu’s (1990) concept of habitus offers a way of bringing an analysis of the body to bear upon an understanding of the social inequalities which are core to the lives of disabled people. Through focus groups with disabled people, the article explores aspects of disabled people’s corporeal identities, feelings and (embodied) encounters in a range of social settings. The research shows that disabled people’s lives are connected to different ‘valuations’ attributed to corporeal forms, and to systems of signiﬁcation and representation, which underpin them. We conclude by reafﬁrming the need to consider Bourdieu’s ideas in helping in the development of disability theory.},

This poset {NPol}(d) is a natural discrete counterpart of the continuum of convex compact sets in Rd , ordered by inclusion, and exhibits a remarkably rich combinatorial structure. We derive various arithmetic bounds on elementary relations in {NPol}(d), called quantum jumps. The existence of extremal objects in {NPol}(d) is a challenge of number theoretical ﬂavor, leading to interesting classes of normal polytopes: minimal, maximal, spherical. Minimal elements in {NPol}(5) have played a critical role in disproving various covering conjectures for normal polytopes in the 1990s. Here we report on the ﬁrst examples of maximal elements in {NPol}(4) and {NPol}(5), found by a combination of the developed theory, random generation, and extensive computer search.},

It analyses the theoretical underpinnings, research methods and definitions of identity, providing a critique rather than a summary of the literature. A total of 188 articles from 85 different journals are reviewed in the sample. This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.},

	abstract = {Background As the maker movement is increasingly adopted into K-12 schools, students are developing new competences in exploration and fabrication technologies. This study assesses learning with these technologies in K-12 makerspaces and {FabLabs}.
Purpose Our study describes the iterative process of developing an assessment instrument for this new technological literacy, the Exploration and Fabrication Technologies Instrument, and presents ﬁndings from implementations at ﬁve schools in three countries. Our index is generalizable and psychometrically sound, and permits comparison between student conﬁdence and performance. Design/Method Our evaluation of distinct technology skills separates general computing, information and communication technology ({ICT}), and exploration and fabrication technologies ({EFTs}) into nonoverlapping areas of technological expertise required to perform their respective sets of tasks. The instrument also tracks student conﬁdence in {EFT} skills and assesses how that conﬁdence relates to actual task performance.
Results Exploration and fabrication technologies constitute a new and distinct set of technology literacies arising from fabrication settings. The {EFT} instrument compares students’ selfreported conﬁdence with their performance on complex design tasks and demonstrates that, for students, exposure to general computing and {ICT} tools differs from exposure to {EFT} tools.
Conclusion The {EFT} instrument captures a new and distinct set of technology literacies that arise within fabrication settings and are independent of both general computing and digital content production skills.},

	abstract = {When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do--with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?
This book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to these and other questions. New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.
How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.
If education is to help students make sense of their surroundings and ready them for the challenges of the technology-driven, internationally competitive world, then it must be based on what we know about learning from science. In that light, this book will be of significant professional interest to teachers, education policymakers and administrators, and curriculum developers.},

In this brief report, we review the evidence to date for the effectiveness of spatial training.

Both the medical and economic definitions have relied primarily on clinical methods. Whereas the medical approach has been operationally measured by limits on major life activities, the economic orientation has been measured by restrictions on the amount or kind of work that can be performed. By contrast, the sociopolitical definition, which focuses on the interaction between the individual and the environment, can be empirically assessed by measures of visibility and labeling. Self-identification is also an important index of the relative size and political strength of disabled persons. Because of the significance of new antidiscrimination laws, which appear to be based on the minority-group model, there is a pressing need to grant operational measures of the sociopolitical definition a position of parity in relation to the vast amount of data that have already been accumulated through the use of medical and economic concepts in government and other surveys.},

	abstract = {The substantial gender gap in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) workforce can be traced back to the underrepresentation of women at various milestones in the career pathway. Calculus is a necessary step in this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing {STEM} fields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested in {STEM} and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking Calculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a {STEM} major or are dissuaded from {STEM} disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on mainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for academic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman being dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for a man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material well enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women and men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find women start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence than men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack of mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of women. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women in {STEM} at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that if women persisted in {STEM} at the same rate as men starting in Calculus I, the number of women entering the {STEM} workforce would increase by 75\%.},

Drawing on personal experience in the ﬁeld, the author responds to several important considerations that need to be addressed before considering adopting this controversial perspective. The paper is divided into two main sections. The ﬁrst part provides a concise introduction to the thinking that underpins the concept of emancipatory disability research. The second section discusses key elements of this approach including the problem of accountability, the social model of disability, choice of methods and, empowerment, dissemination and outcomes. The paper concludes by suggesting that whilst there has been considerable progress over the last decade the future of emancipatory disability research remains precarious.},

The framework for cultural learning pathways is an application and elaboration of Ole Dreier’s theory of persons in diversities of structures of social practice with a focus on the learning of disciplinary practices and the development of discipline-related identities. We summarize relevant learning phenomena along extended cultural pathways from three team ethnographies of science learning. We outline how power-related issues associated with privilege and marginalization are attended to in relation to the social, cultural, and material circumstances of learning within and across environments and discuss future research opportunities.},

The informing of research influences how it is carried out ; the research questions themselves, the choice of design and methods, the form of analysis, and the pattern of dissemination. The seminar series has helped {SPRU} reappraise its disability-related research . Disabled people must be able to influence the framing and elaboration of research questions more directly; there must be an increased commitment to employing and to training disabled researchers ; dissemination must be wider; `crucial gateways' to policy makers and practitioners have to be identified ; and the debate on informal care must be moved further on .},

	abstract = {When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do--with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?
This book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to these and other questions. New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.
How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.
If education is to help students make sense of their surroundings and ready them for the challenges of the technology-driven, internationally competitive world, then it must be based on what we know about learning from science. In that light, this book will be of significant professional interest to teachers, education policymakers and administrators, and curriculum developers.},

	abstract = {With the current trend away from affirmative action programs, it is increasingly important that universities retain the African American and Latino students that they admit. In 1988 the University of Texas at Austin ({UT}) established the Emerging Scholars Program ({ESP}) to challenge high-achieving students to excel in calculus and pursue mathematics, science, or engineering ({MSE}) majors. The university makes a special effort to recruit African Americans, Latinos, and women, but the {ESP} is open to any student, regardless of race or ethnicity, who is committed to excel in calculus. We analyze the influence of calculus performance on choosing a mathematics, science, or engineering major by focusing on variations by race, ethnicity, and gender and on the role of students' participation in the {ESP}. Findings suggest that {ESP} students earn higher calculus grades than non-{ESP} students and are more likely to enroll in the second semester of calculus. Also, earning higher calculus grades increases the likelihood that students will choose a major in mathematics, science, or engineering. These findings suggest that to increase the number of students choosing one of these majors, administrators must seek ways to increase students' participation in calculus each semester. In addition, African Americans, Latinos, and women excel in calculus if they receive appropriate academic challenges and support.},

The authors maintain that learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral participation ({LPP}). Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. {LPP} provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and old-timers and about their activities, identities, artefacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalised to other social groups.},

	title = {Critical Theory},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/critical-theory/},
	abstract = {Critical Theory has a narrow and a broad meaning in philosophy and inthe history of the social sciences. “Critical Theory” inthe narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophersand social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition knownas the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a“critical” theory may be distinguished from a“traditional” theory according to a specific practicalpurpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human“emancipation from slavery”, acts as a “liberating… influence”, and works “to create a world whichsatisfies the needs and powers” of human beings (Horkheimer1972, 246).  Because such theories aim to explain andtransform all the circumstances that enslave human beings,many “critical theories” in the broader sense have beendeveloped. They have emerged in connection with the many socialmovements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of humanbeings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses,however, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normativebases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasingfreedom in all their forms., Critical Theory in the narrow sense has had many different aspects andquite distinct historical phases that cross several generations, fromthe effective start of the Institute for Social Research in the years1929–1930, which saw the arrival of the Frankfurt Schoolphilosophers and an inaugural lecture by Horkheimer, to thepresent. Its distinctiveness as a philosophical approach that extendsto ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history is mostapparent when considered in light of the history of the philosophy ofthe social sciences. Critical Theorists have long sought todistinguish their aims, methods, theories, and forms of explanationfrom standard understandings in both the natural and the socialsciences. Instead, they have claimed that social inquiry ought tocombine rather than separate the poles of philosophy and the socialsciences: explanation and understanding, structure and agency,regularity and normativity.  Such an approach, Critical Theoristsargue, permits their enterprise to be practical in adistinctively moral (rather than instrumental) sense. They do notmerely seek to provide the means to achieve some independent goal, butrather (as in Horkheimer's famous definition mentioned above) seek“human emancipation” in circumstances of domination andoppression. This normative task cannot be accomplished apart from theinterplay between philosophy and social science throughinterdisciplinary empirical social research (Horkheimer 1993). {WhileCritical} Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to {theFrankfurt} School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretchesto Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similarpractical aims could be called a “critical theory,”including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms ofpost-colonial criticism. In the following, Critical Theory whencapitalized refers only to the Frankfurt School. All other uses of theterm are meant in the broader sense and thus not capitalized. Whenused in the singular, “a critical theory” is notcapitalized, even when the theory is developed by members of {theFrankfurt} School in the context of their overall project of {CriticalTheory}., It follows from Horkheimer's definition that a critical theory isadequate only if it meets three criteria: it must be explanatory,practical, and normative, all at the same time. That is, it mustexplain what is wrong with current social reality, identify the actorsto change it, and provide both clear norms for criticism andachievable practical goals for social transformation. Any trulycritical theory of society, as Horkheimer further defined it in hiswritings as Director of the Frankfurt School's Institute for {SocialResearch}, “has as its object human beings as producers of theirown historical form of life” (Horkeimer 1993, 21). In light ofthe practical goal of identifying and overcoming all the circumstancesthat limit human freedom, the explanatory goal could be furthered onlythrough interdisciplinary research that includes psychological,cultural, and social dimensions, as well as institutional forms ofdomination. Given the emphasis among the first generation of {CriticalTheory} on human beings as the self-creating producers of their ownhistory, a unique practical aim of social inquiry suggests itself: totransform contemporary capitalism into a consensual form of sociallife. For Horkheimer a capitalist society could be transformed only bybecoming more democratic, to make it such that “all conditionsof social life that are controllable by human beings depend on realconsensus” in a rational society (Horkheimer 1972, 249–250). Thenormative orientation of Critical Theory, at least in its form ofcritical social inquiry, is therefore towards the transformation ofcapitalism into a “real democracy” in which such controlcould be exercised (Horkheimer 1972, 250). In such formulations, thereare striking similarities between Critical Theory and Americanpragmatism., The focus on democracy as the location for cooperative, practical andtransformative activity continues today in the work of {JürgenHabermas}, as does the attempt to determine the nature and limits of“real democracy” in complex, pluralistic, and globalizingsocieties., As might be expected from such an ambitious philosophical project andform of inquiry, Critical Theory is rife with tensions. In whatfollows I will develop the arguments within Critical Theory thatsurround its overall philosophical project. First, I explore its basicphilosophical orientation or metaphilosophy. In its efforts to combineempirical social inquiry and normative philosophical argumentation,Critical Theory presents a viable alternative for social and politicalphilosophy today. Second, I will consider its core normativetheory—its relation to its transformation of a Kantian ethics ofautonomy into a conception of freedom and justice in which democracyand democratic ideals play a central role (Horkheimer 1993, 22;Horkheimer 1972, 203). As a member of the second generation {ofCritical} Theory, Habermas in particular has developed this dimensionof normative political theory into a competitor to Rawlsianconstructivism, which attempts to bring our pretheoretical intuitionsinto reflective equilibrium. In the third section, I will consider itsempirical orientation in practical social theory and practical socialinquiry that aims at promoting democratic norms. A fundamental tensionemerges between a comprehensive social theory that provides atheoretical basis for social criticism and a more pluralist andpractical orientation that does not see any particular theory ormethodology as distinctive of Critical Theory as such. In this way,the unresolved tension between the empirical and normative aspects ofthe project of a critical theory oriented to the realization of humanfreedom is manifest in each of its main contributions to philosophyinformed by social science. Finally, I examine the contribution {ofCritical} Theory to debates about globalization, in which the potentialtransformation of both democratic ideals and institutions is atstake.},

	title = {Pragmatism},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/pragmatism/},
	abstract = {Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that – very broadly– understands knowing the world as inseparable from agencywithin it. This general idea has attracted a remarkably richand at times contrary range of interpretations, including: that allphilosophical concepts should be tested via scientificexperimentation, that a claim is true if and only if it is useful(relatedly: if a philosophical theory does not contribute directly tosocial progress then it is not worth much), that experience consistsin transacting with rather than representing nature, that articulatelanguage rests on a deep bed of shared human practices that can neverbe fully ‘made explicit’. , Pragmatism originated in the United States around 1870, and nowpresents a growing third alternative to both analytic and‘Continental’ philosophical traditions worldwide. Itsfirst generation was initiated by the so-called ‘classicalpragmatists’ Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), who firstdefined and defended the view, and his close friend and {colleagueWilliam} James (1842–1910), who further developed and ablypopularized it. During this initial period, pragmatists focusedsignificantly on theorising inquiry, meaning and the nature of truth,although James put these themes to work exploring truth in religion. Asecond (still termed ‘classical’) generation turnedpragmatist philosophy more explicitly towards politics, education andother dimensions of social improvement, under the immense influence {ofJohn} Dewey (1859–1952) and his friend Jane Addams(1860–1935) – who invented the profession of social workas an expression of pragmatist ideas (and was awarded the Nobel {PeacePrize} in 1931). Also of considerable importance at this time {wasGeorge} Herbert Mead (1863–1931), who contributed significantlyto the social sciences, developing pragmatist perspectives upon therelations between the self and the community (Mead 1934). As theresulting progressive Deweyan ‘New Deal’ era passed awayand the {US} moved into the Cold War, pragmatism’s influence waschallenged, as analytic philosophy blossomed and became the dominantmethodological orientation in most Anglo-American philosophydepartments.  Transitional or ‘third generation’ figuresincluded C.I. Lewis and W.V.O. Quine; although these philosophersdeveloped a number of pragmatist themes, their analytic allegiance maybe seen in their significant focus on theory of knowledge as firstphilosophy (which Dewey deprecated as ‘the epistemologicalindustry’)., Following this dip in popularity, since the 1970s the pragmatisttradition has undergone a significant revival. Richard Rorty(1931–2007) turned consciously to pragmatism to rectify what he saw as mainstream epistemology’s crucial mistake: naively conceiving oflanguage and thought as ‘mirroring’ the world.Rorty’s bold and iconoclastic attacks on this‘representationalism’ birthed a so-calledneopragmatism to which a number of influential recentphilosophers have contributed (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Robert Brandom {andHuw} Price). Other pragmatists have objected to Rorty’s blithedismissal of truth as a topic better left undiscussed (Rorty 1982),and have sought to rehabilitate classical pragmatist ideals ofobjectivity (e.g. Susan Haack, Christopher Hookway and Cheryl Misak).These philosophers are now sometimes referred to as {NewPragmatists}. Yet others have worked to place pragmatist ideas in abroader Western philosophical context, for instance {tracingPeirce}’s significant debt to Kant (Apel 1974, Gava 2014), andconnections between pragmatism and 19th century idealism (Margolis2010, Stern 2009). Meanwhile, classical pragmatism’s progressivesocial ideals lived on in some quarters, with notable contributions tophilosophy of race made by Cornel West, who advanced a propheticpragmatism drawing on both Christian and Marxian thought (e.g.West 1989). A number of other liberatory philosophical projects inareas such as feminism (Seigfried 1996), ecology (Alexander 2013),Native American philosophy (Pratt 2002) and Latin American philosophy(Pappas 1998) also currently look to the pragmatist tradition as theirphilosophical home. , Meanwhile, increasingly pragmatism’s intellectual centre ofgravity is moving out of North America, with vibrant research networksappearing in South America, Scandinavia and more recently {centralEurope} and China. , The core of pragmatism as Peirce originally conceived it was {thePragmatic} Maxim, a rule for clarifying the meaning of hypotheses bytracing their ‘practical consequences’ – theirimplications for experience in specific situations. For Peirce {andJames}, a key application of the Maxim was clarifying the conceptof truth. This produced a distinctive epistemological outlook:a fallibilist, anti-Cartesian explication of the norms that governinquiry. Within that broad outlook, though, early pragmatists splitsignificantly over questions of realism broadly conceived– essentially, whether pragmatism should conceive itself as ascientific philosophy holding monism about truth (following Peirce),or a more broad-based alethic pluralism (following James {andDewey}). This dispute was poignantly emblematized in arguments {betweenPeirce} and James which led Peirce to rename hisview pragmaticism, presenting this clarified viewpoint to theworld as his new ‘baby’ which was, he hoped, ‘uglyenough to be safe from kidnappers’ ({EP}2: 355)., The first part of this entry is devoted to the classicalpragmatists’ distinctive methods, and how they give rise to anoriginal a posteriori epistemology. After that we will briefly exploresome of the many other areas of philosophy in which rich pragmatistcontributions have been made.},

In our team’s efforts to develop a game-based learning applet for an existing inquiry-oriented curriculum, we have sought to theoretically frame our approach so that we can draw on the corpus of researcher knowledge from multiple disciplines. Accordingly, we will discuss three bodies of literature – realistic mathematics education’s [{RME}’s] approach to curriculum development, inquiry-oriented instruction and inquiry-based learning [{IO}/{IBL}], and game-based learning [{GBL}] - and draw on parallels across the three in order to form a coherent approach to developing digital games that draw on expertise in each field.},

	title = {Cognitive and Affective Components of Undergraduate Students Learning How to Prove},
	abstract = {Students struggle with proving, a fundamental activity in upper-level undergraduate mathematics courses. Learning how to prove is a difficult transition for students, as they shift from largely computation-based to argument-based work. In response, mathematics departments have instituted courses, introduction or transition to proof, designed to help students learn how to prove. Existing research has extensively examined students' errors, struggles, and some of their strategies at a given point in time, but we know little about students' development over a longer period of time. There is a need for longitudinal work in this area, to follow students through the transition to proof. In addition, little is known about the affective side of proving (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, emotions). Affect plays a central role in mathematics learning, influencing students' cognitive processes while problem solving and their motivation to value and want to do mathematics. Understanding affective issues are important, as students consider their future participation in mathematical work and communities. Positive experiences at transitional junctions, such as learning how to prove, are crucial for retention of students through the {STEM} (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) pipeline. The purpose of this work was to explore the cognitive and affective factors involved in undergraduates' efforts to learn how to prove: how their proving developed during a transition to proof course and what kinds of "satisfying moments," i.e. positive emotional reactions, they experienced. Four semi-structured interviews across a semester were conducted with eleven undergraduate students enrolled in a transition to proof course. The resulting data was analyzed using qualitative methods. Findings indicate that students showed growth in fluency, strategy use, and monitoring and judgement over time. Four developments were frequently observed across the sample: (1) increased sophistication in students' rationales for choice of proof techniques, (2) awareness about how a solution attempt was going and managing that for their subsequent strategies, (3) intentional exploring and monitoring when unsure about what direction to pursue, and (4) checking examples in conjunction with other strategies as a way to become unstuck. The variety of developments--and the different ways in which they emerged--is significant, because it confirms that multiple developments occur in different ways, strongly suggesting that there is no one path that students take through the transition to proof. Students' satisfying moments were largely about accomplishments both with and without struggle, understanding, external validation, as well as interacting with others. A theory for how satisfying moments are elicited was proposed. Expectations and a sense of mastery played large roles in mediating satisfying moments, but students' desire for understanding and sense-making was also prominent. This work provides guidance for curriculum design of transition to proof courses, in considering how to support students' development in proving. In addition, examination of just what makes a satisfying moment satisfying is helpful in thinking about how to construct mathematical tasks with opportunities for positive experiences with math.

	abstract = {There are many reasons to be curious about the way people learn, and the past several decades have seen an explosion of research that has important implications for individual learning, schooling, workforce training, and policy.
In 2000, How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition was published and its influence has been wide and deep. The report summarized insights on the nature of learning in school-aged children; described principles for the design of effective learning environments; and provided examples of how that could be implemented in the classroom.
Since then, researchers have continued to investigate the nature of learning and have generated new findings related to the neurological processes involved in learning, individual and cultural variability related to learning, and educational technologies. In addition to expanding scientific understanding of the mechanisms of learning and how the brain adapts throughout the lifespan, there have been important discoveries about influences on learning, particularly sociocultural factors and the structure of learning environments.
How People Learn {II}: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures provides a much-needed update incorporating insights gained from this research over the past decade. The book expands on the foundation laid out in the 2000 report and takes an in-depth look at the constellation of influences that affect individual learning. How People Learn {II} will become an indispensable resource to understand learning throughout the lifespan for educators of students and adults.},

	abstract = {First released in the Spring of 1999, How People Learn has been expanded to show how the theories and insights from the original book can translate into actions and practice, now making a real connection between classroom activities and learning behavior. This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning.

Like the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?  New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.

How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system.

Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.},

This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose "cognitive apprenticeship" (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.]},

This paper argues that part of the connection is rhetorical. Quantitative methods express the assumptions of a positvisit paradigm which holds that behavior can be explained through objective facts. Design and instrumentation persuade by showing how bias and error are eliminated. Qualitative methods express the assumptions of a phenomenological paradigm that there are multiple realities that are socially defined. Rich description persuades by showing that the researcher was immersed in the setting and giving the reader enough detail to ?make sense? of the situation. While rhetorically different, the results of the two methodologies can be complementary. Examples are drawn from two studies using different methodologies to study the same problem.},

Since related empirical research is limited in investigating the effects of using free mobile {AR} apps integrating Keller’s {ARCS} (attention-relevance-confidence-satisfaction) motivation model on learning motivation, anxiety, and outcomes between students with different levels of anxiety in primary math education, this study investigated whether mobile {AR} differently affected learning, motivation, and math anxiety between students with high and low anxiety. The results showed that the {AR} group performed better than the non-{AR} group, and high-anxiety learners in the {AR} group outperformed in algebra and geometry. The {AR} group had higher motivation based on Keller’s {ARCS} model. The highanxiety learners had higher confidence and satisfaction and lower anxiety when learning using mobile {AR}. The {AR} users were satisfied with ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, and benefit from exploration and hands-on experiences. Moreover, highanxiety users in the {AR} group had higher perceptions of exploration, hands-on experiences, and playfulness.

Awe is also hypothesised to be an antecedent to interest in science because science is one way to ﬁll those knowledge gaps. Results from four pre-registered studies (N = 1518) indicate that manipulating awe through online (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c) and virtual reality (Study 2) videos, led to greater awareness of knowledge gaps. Awareness of knowledge gaps was consistently associated with greater science interest and to choosing tickets to a science museum over tickets to an art museum (Study 1b). These eﬀects were not consistently observed on, nor moderated by, other measures related to cognition, religion, and spirituality. However, exploratory analyses showed that science interest was better predicted by positive emotions than by awe. Still, these results provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence of awe as an “epistemic emotion” by demonstrating its eﬀects on awareness of knowledge gaps. These ﬁndings are also extended to the eﬀects of awe on science interest as one possible outcome of awareness of knowledge gaps.},

Our overarching purpose in this chapter is to explicate challenges that teachers must manage in putting into practice certain forms of classroom discourse. We focus on these challenges to (a) shed light on what it takes to successfully implement classroom discussion, and (b) inform researchers who need to understand these dimensions to design and interpret research on classroom instruction. We selectively review some strands of the literature on classroom discourse to describe a set of dimensions that we think are important for teacher practice and development, and for researchers who seek to better understand certain forms of classroom discourse.},

We aim to close this gap by designing a learning-companion robot to augment guided reading activity and examine the robot’s impact on an in-home reading experience. In this paper, we compare the experiences of early adolescent children aged 10 to 12 (N = 24) who either completed guided reading activities with a learning-companion robot or as a paper-based activity in a two-week long, in-home field study. We found similar reading frequency and duration in both conditions and that both guided reading activities were described as positive experiences that help build reading skill and sustain engagement. Children who read with the learning-companion robot further reported that the activities supported reading comprehension and motivated them to read and indicated a deepening social connection (i.e., companionship or affiliation) with the robot. We conclude that rather than the activity falling off after a novelty effect, our simple prototype social robot is capable of preserving the benefits of an existing in-home learning activity while transforming the reading experience into a valuable, social one. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how we might capitalize on the capacity of social robots to serve as a transformative learning tool as robots become more widely available to the public.},

According to our studies in vocational schools, paper-based interfaces have the potential of making educational workflows tangible, i.e. both visible and manipulable. Our studies in university classes converge on minimalism: they reveal the effectiveness o tools that make visible what is invisible but do not analyze, predict or decide for teachers. These studies revealed a third circle of usability. The first circle concerns individual usability ({HCI}). The second circle is about design for teams ({CSCL}/{CSCW}). The third circle raises design choices that impart visibility, reification and minimalism on classroom orchestration. The fact that a {CSCL} environment allows or not students to look at what the next team is doing (e.g. tabletops versus desktops) illustrates the third circle issues that are important for orchestration.},

Vulnerable populations are at risk of experiencing inequalities in health experiences and health outcomes, and research beneﬁcial to those being researched is crucial to address disparities. Often vulnerable populations are exposed to research that is driven by dominant epistemologies, research methodologies, and socio-cultural lenses that can exacerbate their vulnerability, negating their socio-cultural reality. In this paper it is contended that researchers should review the way in which research is constructed and developed by creating a culturally safe space for research to occur with those who are vulnerable. A framework based on partnership, participation, protection, and power is presented as a way of creating culturally safe research.},

Taking an opposite stand, this article will argue that it is in fact unethical not to research vulnerable populations because, by excluding potential participants from research endeavours, they are being deprived of the benefits to be gained from research. Albeit well meaning, people in vulnerable populations are also being subjected to the paternalistic attitudes of those who believe they know what is in the best interests of others. There is ample evidence in existing literature that, not only is research among vulnerable populations unlikely to result in harm, but there are often benefits to be gained by both participants and researchers. Apart from the generic benefits of increased knowledge and improved health interventions, specific benefits for participants might be: therapeutic, cathartic, educational, empowering, altruistic and social. In contrast, the risks associated with researching vulnerable populations appear to be minimal. Yet, there is still evidence that health care professionals and other gatekeepers continue to hinder research amongst vulnerable populations through unilateral decision-making. This article will review existing literature on the topic of research amongst vulnerable populations, as well as contribute to the argument from the author’s own study on a sensitive topic.},

	abstract = {K-12 classroom settings are not yet incorporating emerging technologies such as ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, nor even touch surfaces, despite the significant impact that such media have made in many other aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, classroom environments have not generally evolved to support students in the new modes of collaboration, idea sharing, and inquiry that characterize many of our research-based innovations. Responding to this challenge, our research was conducted by a multi-disciplinary design team including educational researchers, a high school physics teacher, and technology designers. We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students’ physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry. One important outcome of this work is a set of design principles for supporting smart classroom research.},

Twenty five objects and videos were prepared and tested by a focus group. Their suggestions were incorporated into a pilot test at a residential school for the Deaf. Four fifth grade students participated in a usability study. Results were mixed with researchers observing successful use of Google Glass by all participants along with enthusiastic engagement, but also recording a lengthy learning curve and hardware issues that distracted from the learning process. Wearable augmented reality is still in its infancy, but potential was demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality represents an emerging technology, which can be successfully used to develop training tools in many domains, such as military, space, education or healthcare. The current paper proposes a training strategy for a sensory substitution device in order to improve the ability of visually impaired people to be autonomous, thus to increase the quality of their lives. The core of the strategy is a highly interactive virtual training environment, composed of 3D scenes simulating both realistic and imaginary settings. The training is based on gamification principles, as the virtual environment is designed as a highly immersive serious game, with essential elements such as quests, rewards or increasing complexity of tasks which can maintain its users motivated and help them acquire useful day-to-day life skills. Also, a series of mini-games are available in the training environment, as repetitive actions can facilitate the improvement of specific skills. By using appropriate hardware equipment, the virtual training environment can be rendered to the visually impaired users through acoustic and haptic means. The paper presents our proposed training strategy based on virtual reality in the context of numerous challenges of offering efficient training experiences to users with special needs.},

This is especially unfortunate as such environments hold great potential for them for uses such as social interaction, online education and especially for use with familiarizing the visually impaired user with a real environment virtually from the comfort and safety of his own home before visiting it in the real world. We have implemented a simple algorithm to improve this situation using single-point depth information, enabling the blind to use a virtual cane, modeled on the “{EyeCane}” electronic travel aid, within any virtual environment with minimal preprocessing. Use of the Virtual-{EyeCane}, enables this experience to potentially be later used in real world environments with identical stimuli to those from the virtual environment. We show the fast-learned practical use of this algorithm for navigation in simple environments.},
