We begin by discussing the limitations of reductive conceptions of disability. In so doing, we consider how far Bourdieu’s (1990) concept of habitus offers a way of bringing an analysis of the body to bear upon an understanding of the social inequalities which are core to the lives of disabled people. Through focus groups with disabled people, the article explores aspects of disabled people’s corporeal identities, feelings and (embodied) encounters in a range of social settings. The research shows that disabled people’s lives are connected to different ‘valuations’ attributed to corporeal forms, and to systems of signiﬁcation and representation, which underpin them. We conclude by reafﬁrming the need to consider Bourdieu’s ideas in helping in the development of disability theory.},

This poset {NPol}(d) is a natural discrete counterpart of the continuum of convex compact sets in Rd , ordered by inclusion, and exhibits a remarkably rich combinatorial structure. We derive various arithmetic bounds on elementary relations in {NPol}(d), called quantum jumps. The existence of extremal objects in {NPol}(d) is a challenge of number theoretical ﬂavor, leading to interesting classes of normal polytopes: minimal, maximal, spherical. Minimal elements in {NPol}(5) have played a critical role in disproving various covering conjectures for normal polytopes in the 1990s. Here we report on the ﬁrst examples of maximal elements in {NPol}(4) and {NPol}(5), found by a combination of the developed theory, random generation, and extensive computer search.},

It analyses the theoretical underpinnings, research methods and definitions of identity, providing a critique rather than a summary of the literature. A total of 188 articles from 85 different journals are reviewed in the sample. This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.},

	abstract = {Background As the maker movement is increasingly adopted into K-12 schools, students are developing new competences in exploration and fabrication technologies. This study assesses learning with these technologies in K-12 makerspaces and {FabLabs}.
Purpose Our study describes the iterative process of developing an assessment instrument for this new technological literacy, the Exploration and Fabrication Technologies Instrument, and presents ﬁndings from implementations at ﬁve schools in three countries. Our index is generalizable and psychometrically sound, and permits comparison between student conﬁdence and performance. Design/Method Our evaluation of distinct technology skills separates general computing, information and communication technology ({ICT}), and exploration and fabrication technologies ({EFTs}) into nonoverlapping areas of technological expertise required to perform their respective sets of tasks. The instrument also tracks student conﬁdence in {EFT} skills and assesses how that conﬁdence relates to actual task performance.
Results Exploration and fabrication technologies constitute a new and distinct set of technology literacies arising from fabrication settings. The {EFT} instrument compares students’ selfreported conﬁdence with their performance on complex design tasks and demonstrates that, for students, exposure to general computing and {ICT} tools differs from exposure to {EFT} tools.
Conclusion The {EFT} instrument captures a new and distinct set of technology literacies that arise within fabrication settings and are independent of both general computing and digital content production skills.},

	abstract = {When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do--with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?
This book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to these and other questions. New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.
How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.
If education is to help students make sense of their surroundings and ready them for the challenges of the technology-driven, internationally competitive world, then it must be based on what we know about learning from science. In that light, this book will be of significant professional interest to teachers, education policymakers and administrators, and curriculum developers.},

Although spatial ability can be improved with targeted training, few studies have examined specifically the relation between spatial training and {STEM} achievement. In this brief report, we review the evidence to date for the effectiveness of spatial training. We argue that spatial training offers one of the many promising avenues for increasing student success in {STEM} fields, but research studies that show such training causally improve retention, achievement, and degree attainment remain outstanding.},

Both the medical and economic definitions have relied primarily on clinical methods. Whereas the medical approach has been operationally measured by limits on major life activities, the economic orientation has been measured by restrictions on the amount or kind of work that can be performed. By contrast, the sociopolitical definition, which focuses on the interaction between the individual and the environment, can be empirically assessed by measures of visibility and labeling. Self-identification is also an important index of the relative size and political strength of disabled persons. Because of the significance of new antidiscrimination laws, which appear to be based on the minority-group model, there is a pressing need to grant operational measures of the sociopolitical definition a position of parity in relation to the vast amount of data that have already been accumulated through the use of medical and economic concepts in government and other surveys.},

	abstract = {The substantial gender gap in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) workforce can be traced back to the underrepresentation of women at various milestones in the career pathway. Calculus is a necessary step in this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing {STEM} fields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested in {STEM} and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking Calculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a {STEM} major or are dissuaded from {STEM} disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on mainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for academic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman being dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for a man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material well enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women and men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find women start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence than men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack of mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of women. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women in {STEM} at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that if women persisted in {STEM} at the same rate as men starting in Calculus I, the number of women entering the {STEM} workforce would increase by 75\%.},

Drawing on personal experience in the ﬁeld, the author responds to several important considerations that need to be addressed before considering adopting this controversial perspective. The paper is divided into two main sections. The ﬁrst part provides a concise introduction to the thinking that underpins the concept of emancipatory disability research. The second section discusses key elements of this approach including the problem of accountability, the social model of disability, choice of methods and, empowerment, dissemination and outcomes. The paper concludes by suggesting that whilst there has been considerable progress over the last decade the future of emancipatory disability research remains precarious.},

The framework for cultural learning pathways is an application and elaboration of Ole Dreier’s theory of persons in diversities of structures of social practice with a focus on the learning of disciplinary practices and the development of discipline-related identities. We summarize relevant learning phenomena along extended cultural pathways from three team ethnographies of science learning. We outline how power-related issues associated with privilege and marginalization are attended to in relation to the social, cultural, and material circumstances of learning within and across environments and discuss future research opportunities.},

The informing of research influences how it is carried out ; the research questions themselves, the choice of design and methods, the form of analysis, and the pattern of dissemination. The seminar series has helped {SPRU} reappraise its disability-related research . Disabled people must be able to influence the framing and elaboration of research questions more directly; there must be an increased commitment to employing and to training disabled researchers ; dissemination must be wider; `crucial gateways' to policy makers and practitioners have to be identified ; and the debate on informal care must be moved further on .},

	abstract = {When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do--with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively?
This book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to these and other questions. New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.
How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.
If education is to help students make sense of their surroundings and ready them for the challenges of the technology-driven, internationally competitive world, then it must be based on what we know about learning from science. In that light, this book will be of significant professional interest to teachers, education policymakers and administrators, and curriculum developers.},
